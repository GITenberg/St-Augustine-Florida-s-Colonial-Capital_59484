<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />Settlement</h2>
<p>It all began at a little bay on
the east coast of Florida during
September of 1565. Two large
galleons rode at anchor outside the
harbor entrance, while three smaller
craft with sails furled and pennants
flying from each masthead were moored
within. The ships were a part of the
fleet of Don Pedro Men&eacute;ndez. They
brought an expedition from Spain to
establish settlements in Florida and
drive out the French Huguenots, who
had a fort near the mouth of the St.
Johns River in this Spanish-claimed
territory. The French colony, named
Fort Caroline, lay only some thirty-five
miles up the coast from the point
where the Spanish ships were anchored.
There on this very same day Jean Ribault,
who had just arrived from
France with reinforcements, was preparing
to attack the Spaniards before
they could finish landing and fortify
their position.</p>
<p>During the late forenoon, Men&eacute;ndez
and a group of his officers transferred
from the larger of the two galleons
offshore to a smaller boat alongside.
Aided by a strong incoming tide,
the boat entered the inlet and advanced
across the bay toward the mainland,
heading for a little creek that wound
among the marshes to higher ground.
As it neared this point, the roar of
cannon and the blare of trumpets
startled huge flocks of marsh birds
into noisy flight.</p>
<p>On shore curious Indians looked out
upon the scene with mingled fear and
wonder. A Spanish detachment, which
previously had disembarked, was drawn
up along the bank to greet the landing
party. From their ranks a robe-clad
priest emerged holding aloft a cross
and singing in a clear voice the Latin
words of the <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday, the 8th [of September],&rdquo;
relates the priest, Francisco L&oacute;pez de
Mendoza, Chaplain of the Spanish
fleet, &ldquo;the General landed with
many banners spread, to the sound of
trumpets and salutes of artillery. As
I had gone ashore the evening before,
I took the Cross and went to meet
him, singing the hymn <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>.
The General, followed by all
who accompanied him, marched up to
the Cross, knelt and kissed it. A large
number of Indians watched these proceedings
and imitated all they saw done.
The General then took formal possession
of the country in the name of his
Majesty, and all the captains took the
oath of allegiance to him as their leader
and Governor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Beneath the gnarled oaks festooned
with moss the Spanish knelt before a
rustic altar to celebrate the first parish
Mass on Florida soil.</p>
<p>Men&eacute;ndez had instructed his advance
landing party to select a location
suitable for an entrenchment and fort.
For this purpose they had taken over
the Indian village of <i>Seloy</i> and the
&ldquo;great house&rdquo; of its cacique, which
stood close to the river bank. Around it
the Spaniards were hastily digging a
trench and throwing up an embankment
of earth. Some cannon were already
mounted behind this breastwork.
Men&eacute;ndez was well pleased with what
had been accomplished. After holding
a council with his officers he returned
to his ships to hasten the unloading of
the rest of his company, artillery, and
supplies before the French might descend
upon them.</p>
<p>When he had first come upon this
little bay and inlet, chosen for his
base, he gave it the name St. Augustine
in honor of the Saint&rsquo;s day (August
28th), on which his ships first sighted
the Florida coast.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><i>The Spanish Treasure Fleets</i></h3>
<p>At the time of St. Augustine&rsquo;s founding
Spain was the most powerful nation
in Europe. Sailing under her banner,
Christopher Columbus in 1492 had
initiated the discovery of strange new
lands across the sea. Other intrepid
explorers followed&mdash;Spanish, French,
English, Dutch, and Portuguese&mdash;searching
for the coveted sea-route to
the Indies. The vast extent and wealth
of the New World began to unfold.</p>
<p>Thus far only Spain, and to a lesser
extent Portugal, had taken advantage
of their discoveries. Almost two hundred
Spanish settlements had been established
in portions of the West Indies,
Mexico, Central and South America
by the time St. Augustine came into
being. Fleets of galleons laden with
riches from these colonies began to sail
slowly across the Atlantic to Spanish
ports. They became known as the
<i>treasure fleets</i> because they carried fortunes
in gold and silver. Spain&rsquo;s European
rivals watched this flow of fabulous
wealth with bitter envy, and pirates
preyed increasingly upon it. Some
were genuine outlaws; others were
merely adventurers, whose piracy had
the tacit approval of their sovereigns.</p>
<p>The vessels of the treasure fleets
usually assembled at Havana, Cuba.
From that point their route, taking
advantage of the strong Gulf Stream
current, lay up along the east coast of
Florida and Carolina, thence east to
Spain. This was an important lifeline
in the then great and powerful
Spanish Empire.</p>
<p>Back in 1513 Ponce de Le&oacute;n, sailing
northwestward from Puerto Rico in
search of rumored wealth and, it was
later said, youth-giving waters, discovered
the Florida peninsula. Landing
in the vicinity of St. Augustine, he
claimed the territory for Spain and
gave it the poetic name <i>La Florida</i>,
because he first sighted its green shores
during the Easter season, called by
the Spaniards <i>Pascua Florida</i>.</p>

<p>Although Florida occupied a strategic
location along the route of the
treasure fleets, it remained unsettled
for fifty years following its discovery.
Numerous Spanish expeditions, such as
those of Narv&aacute;ez, De Soto, and Trist&aacute;n
de Luna set out to explore, conquer
and colonize Florida, but instead
of gold and silver the conquistadores
found only suffering and death in its
wild interior or along its beaches.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="pcap"><i>Indians worshipping one of the columns set up by Ribault, from a drawing
by the French artist, Le Moyne.</i></p>
</div>
<p>During this period of exploration
and colonization Europe was the scene
of bitter religious conflict. Spain,
which was solidly a Catholic country,
endeavored to stamp out all deviations
from its faith. While neighboring
France was predominantly Catholic,
there were a number of Protestants in
the country. They were called Huguenots
and included some Frenchmen of
noble birth.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>The Huguenots Occupy Florida</i></h3>
<p>Admiral Gaspard Coligny, leader of
the French Protestants, or Huguenots,
dreamed of establishing colonies in the
New World that might rival Spain&rsquo;s
in riches and importance. An attempted
settlement in Brazil in 1555 was destroyed
by the Portuguese. In 1562 he
sent out a small expedition under an
able Huguenot navigator, Jean Ribault.
These Frenchmen, after exploring a
portion of the north Florida and lower
Carolina coast and setting up columns
claiming the land for France, built a
small fort near Port Royal, South
Carolina, which was soon abandoned
by the small garrison left there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>During the next two years fighting
broke out in France between the
Catholics and Huguenots, preventing
further colonizing activity. When
peace was restored Coligny sent out a
second and larger expedition in 1564,
consisting of three vessels, under Ren&eacute;
de Laudonni&egrave;re, who had accompanied
Ribault on the first voyage. These
colonists chose as a site for their settlement
a point near the mouth of the
St. Johns River in present-day Florida.
There they built a fort, named Fort
Caroline in honor of their boy king,
Charles IX.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap"><i>Ren&eacute; de Laudonni&egrave;re.</i></p>
</div>
<p>After searching the area in vain for
evidences of gold and silver, the Frenchmen
ran short of provisions and were
forced to subsist mainly on food bartered
or seized from the Indians. Meanwhile,
some of their number mutinied
and sailed away to attack Spanish shipping
in the Caribbean. The rest were
on the point of returning to France
when Sir John Hawkins, an English
freebooter, happened by and sold them
one of his ships and needed supplies.
They were again about to embark for
France, when sails appeared off the
river&rsquo;s mouth. They were the ships
of Jean Ribault bringing strong reinforcements.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Admiral Gaspard de Coligny.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When Philip II of Spain and his
advisors learned of these French
Huguenot activities in Florida, they
were greatly alarmed. The French
fort, if allowed to remain so close to
the route of the treasure fleets, would
constantly expose them to attack. Manrique
de Rojas was dispatched from
Cuba to investigate. During May of
1564 he sailed up the Florida coast
looking for signs of a French settlement,
but found only one of the columns
left by Ribault, the abandoned
fort and a French boy at Port Royal.
Laudonni&egrave;re did not arrive on the
coast until late June of that year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>Philip II, the King of Spain, who commissioned
Men&eacute;ndez to settle Florida,
and later supervised the colony during
its early years.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The sovereigns of Spain and France
were at the time allied by marriage.
The wife of Philip II of Spain was
the daughter of the Queen Regent of
France, the crafty Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.
Philip protested to Catherine through
his minister concerning the presence of
her subjects in Florida, but received
only evasive replies to the effect that
they had merely gone to a land called
<i>Newe France</i>, discovered many years
before by French seamen. It became
increasingly clear that to safeguard its
claim to the territory, and protect the
route of the treasure fleets, Spain
would need to establish forts of its
own in Florida and expel the French
trespassers from its shores.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><i>Don Pedro Men&eacute;ndez</i></h3>
<p>The man destined to establish the
first permanent settlement in Florida
and expel the French Huguenots was
a Spaniard of noble lineage, Don Pedro
Men&eacute;ndez. Born in 1519 in the little
seaport town of Avil&eacute;s, on the northern
coast of Spain, he was one of a large
family and upon the death of his father
was sent to be reared by relatives.
Against their wishes he went to sea
while still in his teens to fight the
pirates, or corsairs, who lurked along
the nearby French and Spanish coasts.
Within a few years he learned to command
and navigate a vessel of his own.
The sea was in his blood.</p>
<p>His courage and expert seamanship
caused him to rise rapidly in royal
favor. He soon advanced to the most
important naval post in Spain, that
of Captain-General of the armada, or
guard of heavily armed ships that accompanied
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the treasure fleets on their
long voyages to and from the New
World through pirate-infested waters,
receiving this appointment directly
from the King. But his rise to prominence
also created jealous enemies.
Among these were officials of the
<i>Casa de Contrataci&oacute;n</i>, or Board of
Trade, who formerly had appointed
and controlled the armada&rsquo;s commander,
and deeply resented loss of
this authority.</p>
<p>When Men&eacute;ndez and his brother,
Bartolom&eacute;, returned from a voyage to
the New World with the treasure fleet
in 1563, they were met by armed officers
of the <i>Casa</i>, arrested and imprisoned
on vague charges related to
smuggling or accepting bribes. Soon
after this occurred, Men&eacute;ndez learned
that his only son, Don Juan, had been
shipwrecked on the coast of Florida,
or vicinity of Bermuda, while returning
with a portion of the fleet. He
hoped and prayed that some day he
might find his son alive, possibly held
captive by the coastal Indians.</p>
<p>After over a year&rsquo;s delay Men&eacute;ndez
was finally brought to trial and fined.
Upon his release from prison, he immediately
sought an audience with
King Philip II to secure his permission
for a voyage to Florida in search
of his lost son, and to further explore
its coast on which many Spanish ships
were being wrecked. Philip II not only
granted permission for his voyage, but
welcomed this opportunity to commission
him to undertake the settlement
of Florida, and the task of dealing
with the French Huguenots, who had
gained a foothold there. Gratefully
Men&eacute;ndez knelt and kissed his monarch&rsquo;s
hand. Here was an opportunity
to recoup his fallen fortunes.</p>
<p>As customary in such matters, a
royal <i>asiento</i>, or contract, was executed.
By it Men&eacute;ndez was bound to establish
three fortified posts in Florida at
his own expense, and within a specified
time. In return he was to receive a
substantial share of any riches that
might be found there, certain privileges
of trade, and the title of <i>Adelantado</i>
and Governor of the Province
of Florida in perpetuity.</p>
<p>The contract also provided that Men&eacute;ndez
should make every effort to
convert the natives of Florida to Christianity,
and for that purpose several
priests were assigned to the expedition
and others were to be brought over
later.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c5"><i>The Rival Fleets</i></h3>
<p>With characteristic vigor Men&eacute;ndez
began collecting ships and recruiting
followers for his Florida expedition.
In the midst of his preparations, intelligence
reached Spain that a strong
French fleet under Jean Ribault was
being readied to sail for Florida to
reinforce Fort Caroline. More arms
and soldiers would be needed. The
royal arsenals were thrown open and
the King agreed to furnish one vessel
and three hundred soldiers at his own
expense. By late June, Men&eacute;ndez had
assembled a formidable armada of
some nineteen ships and 1,500 persons,
most of it concentrated at the Spanish
port of Cadiz. There were scenes of
parting from loved ones, the last solemn
Mass at the Cathedral. Anchors were
weighed and on June 29, 1565, the
expedition set sail, but was driven back
by a storm and put to sea several
days later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rival French fleet
under Jean Ribault had sailed a month
earlier, leaving the port of Dieppe,
France, on May 28th, but unfavorable
winds delayed its progress. The Spanish
fleet put in at the Canary Islands
for wood and water, and to take a
muster of its forces.
After leaving the Canaries,
it ran into a severe Atlantic
storm, which damaged some of the
vessels and drove others far off their
course. As a result, Men&eacute;ndez reached
San Juan, Puerto Rico, on about August
10th with but one-third of his
original force.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Fleet at sea." width="800" height="405" />
</div>
<p>A council of war was held. Should
they go on or wait until the rest of
the fleet might arrive? Men&eacute;ndez
convinced his officers that it would be
best to press on before the French had
time to further strengthen their position.
Sailing northwestward, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Spaniards sighted the shores of Florida
on August 28th. It was St. Augustine&rsquo;s
day and <i>Te Deums</i> were sung.
On the same day Ribault&rsquo;s fleet reached
the mouth of the St. Johns River.</p>
<p>Ignorant of the location of the
French fort, the Spanish ships crept
cautiously up the Florida coast, sailing
by day and anchoring at night. On
the fifth day Indians were sighted
on shore. A party landed, followed
by Men&eacute;ndez himself, and learned
from the Indians that the French fort
lay thirty leagues (90 miles) to the
north. Continuing on up the coast,
the Spaniards paused at the inlet and
harbor of St. Augustine, where Men&eacute;ndez
decided to establish his base.
They sailed northward again the next
day, and about three in the afternoon
their lookouts sighted four ships on
the horizon. A sudden thunder shower
obscured them temporarily from view,
followed by a calm that lasted until
evening. Then a light breeze enabled
the Spaniards to bring their ships within
hailing distance.</p>
<p>About midnight Men&eacute;ndez ordered
trumpets sounded. &ldquo;Whence comes
this fleet,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;and what
is it doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From France,&rdquo; a French spokesman
replied, &ldquo;and it brings infantry,
artillery, and supplies for a fort the
King of France has in this land, and
to equip many more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p07a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="562" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The French ships sighted.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Men&eacute;ndez then informed them of
his mission, stating that he had no
choice but to carry out his King&rsquo;s commands.
The French Huguenots answered
him with threats and jeers, and
dared the Spaniards to come on.
Angered by this, Men&eacute;ndez prepared
to board the French vessels, but instead
of waiting to meet the attack
the French put to sea. The Spaniards
opened fire, raised anchor, and sailed
in pursuit, but could not overtake them
because the masts and rigging of their
ships had been damaged in the Atlantic
storm.</p>
<p>The following morning Men&eacute;ndez
returned to the mouth of the St. Johns
River to reconnoiter the French position.
Finding it too strong to assault,
he sailed back down the coast to the
inlet and harbor chosen for his base.
There on September 8, 1565, as previously
related, he landed with fitting
pomp to take possession of Florida and
found the fortified settlement of St.
Augustine. A French vessel hovered
a short distance out at sea to watch
the Spaniards&rsquo; movements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h3 id="c6"><i>The Turn of the Tide</i></h3>
<p>Men&eacute;ndez next began the task of
completing the unloading of his vessels.
People, heavy artillery, arms, building
implements, kegs of powder, boxes and
hogsheads of supplies, casks of wine
and olive oil, chests of clothing and
personal effects all had to be transferred
to smaller boats to be brought
ashore. Two of his vessels, his <i>Capitana</i>
or flagship, the <i>San Pelayo</i>, and
another galleon proved too large to
enter the shallow inlet. They were
ordered to leave for Cuba to secure
reinforcements as soon as most of their
heavy cargo could be removed.</p>
<p>Before daybreak on the morning of
September 11th, Men&eacute;ndez watched
the two galleons set sail. With a
sloop and smaller craft, loaded with
150 soldiers and supplies, he waited
outside the inlet for a favorable breeze
and for the tide to turn. Out of the
early morning mist the ghostly shapes
of French ships loomed. Ribault had
come to attack St. Augustine before
it was barely three days old. Ordering
the anchor cables of his boats cut,
Men&eacute;ndez managed to pilot them to
safety across the dangerous bar, which
the French vessels could not navigate
until about flood tide.</p>
<p>On shore the Spaniards prepared
desperately to meet the threatened attack.
Then, seemingly, a miracle occurred.
The weather, which up to
this time had been relatively fair,
abruptly changed. Strong northerly
winds arose, preventing the French
from entering the inlet or returning
north to their fort on the St. Johns.
One of those northeast storms, common
to this section of the coast in the fall,
whipped up high waves on the bay and
sea. A driving rain fell and dark
clouds raced overhead.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><i>Capture of Fort Caroline</i></h3>
<p>Men&eacute;ndez knew that the French
vessels would be driven helplessly before
the raging storm. He also correctly
surmised that Ribault had taken
aboard most of the French fighting
force, leaving Fort Caroline weakly
garrisoned. He called a secret council
of his officers to outline his next step.
Since rough weather made it impossible
to reach the French fort by sea, he
proposed the daring course of marching
overland to surprise Fort Caroline
before Ribault could return to its assistance.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 16th
Men&eacute;ndez and 500 picked men attended
Mass. Then through the wind
and rain they plunged into the wilderness,
guided by two Indians who had
been at the French fort a few days
before. Men&eacute;ndez and a small party
of axmen went ahead to clear a trail
and blaze the trees so that the men
following would not lose their way.
At places they waded through swamps
flooded waist-deep by the storm, at
night seeking higher ground on which
to camp and build a fire. Some became
exhausted; others lost courage
and turned back. On the evening of
September 19th the Spaniards reached
the vicinity of the enemy fort. They
were drenched to the skin, their powder
damp and useless. It was still raining
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
and the wind whistled weirdly through
the pines.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="575" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fort Caroline, as pictured by Le Moyne, consisted of a triangular stockade
of earth and logs, within which barracks and other buildings were located.</i></p>
</div>
<p>With the first light of dawn a
Spanish detachment, guided by a
French deserter, advanced into the
clearing that surrounded Fort Caroline.
A few Frenchmen quartered outside
the stockade fled in alarm. Hearing
their cries, a soldier within opened
the wicket, or little door, of the main
gate to admit them. He was quickly
killed by the advancing Spaniards, who
broke into a run and poured into the
enclosure, shouting &ldquo;Santiago! Victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surprise was complete. Sleepy-eyed
Frenchmen, some still in their
night clothes, became the easy victims
of Spanish arms. Laudonni&egrave;re and
some fifty of the garrison managed to
escape to the surrounding swamps, and
thence to French boats anchored in
the river. Among them was the artist
Le Moyne, whose drawings of Fort
Caroline, and the early Florida Indians
were later engraved and published by
De Bry.</p>
<p>Leaving most of his force to garrison
the captured fort, which he renamed
San Mateo, Men&eacute;ndez set out
with a small detachment to return to
St. Augustine.</p>

<h3 id="c8"><i>The Victor Returns</i></h3>
<p>At St. Augustine work continued on
strengthening its defenses. A week
passed without news of the attacking
expedition. Only exhausted stragglers
returned with terrifying reports of the
swamps and other difficulties encountered.
Gloom and despair settled
over the camp until one afternoon a
ragged Spaniard burst out of the woodland,
shouting &ldquo;Victory! Victory! the
harbor of the French is ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four priests who were there [at
St. Augustine] immediately set out,

all the sea and land forces, the women
and children in procession, singing the

the Adelantado with great rejoicing,
everyone laughing and weeping for
joy, praising God for so great a victory.
And so they escorted the Adelantado
in triumph to the encampment and

<h3 id="c9"><i>Fate of the Shipwrecked French</i></h3>
<p>No word had yet been received as
to Ribault&rsquo;s fleet, which had been
caught in the storm off St. Augustine.
His ships, driven aground many miles
down the coast, were being pounded
to pieces in the surf. Most of the men
aboard had reached shore safely with
their arms. Hungry and constantly
harassed by Indians, they were endeavoring
to make their way up the
beaches back to their fort. How they
longed to be back in their beloved
France!</p>
<p>Four days after Men&eacute;ndez returned
from Fort Caroline, Indians made
known by signs that a party of men
were marooned on the shores of an
inlet fifteen miles south of St. Augustine.
He immediately set out with a
small force of soldiers and, on reaching
the inlet at dawn, saw two hundred
Frenchmen gathered on the opposite
shore. One of their number swam
across the inlet and was told to inform
his comrades of Fort Caroline&rsquo;s fate.
They at first refused to believe that
the Spaniards could have taken it, but
as proof were shown captured French
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
arms and clothing. Fruitless parleys
followed. Faced with starvation or
probable death at the hands of the
Indians, the entire French band unconditionally
surrendered.</p>
<p>A boat was sent over to bring back
their weapons and standards. Then
the French captives were ferried across
the inlet ten at a time. As each group
landed, their hands were bound behind
them with matchcords, and they were
led up the beach out of sight and hearing
behind high dunes. As they reached
a fatal line drawn by Men&eacute;ndez in
the sand, their captors slew them with
swords and daggers, and then returned
to the inlet to escort another group of
ten to their doom. Only a few were
spared.</p>
<p>About two weeks later another party
of Frenchmen, who had been shipwrecked
farther down the coast, arrived
at the same inlet. Some eighty,
including their brave leader, Jean Ribault,
gave themselves up and were
disposed of in the same manner as
before. A number refused to place
themselves at the Spaniards&rsquo; mercy and
withdrew to the south. When Men&eacute;ndez
returned to St. Augustine his
brother-in-law, Solis de Mer&aacute;s, observed
that &ldquo;some people considered him
cruel, and others that he had acted
as a very good captain should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spanish word <i>Matanzas</i>, meaning
slaughters, became the name of
the inlet near which the massacres occurred.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fort Matanzas stands near the inlet, where the French were slain.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h3 id="c10"><i>Other Difficulties</i></h3>
<p>The French attempt to occupy Florida
was thus effectively shattered.
Other difficulties threatened the permanence
of its settlement and remained
to be overcome&mdash;the unyielding wilderness,
the treacherous Indians, the
colonists&rsquo; lust for gold, and hunger,
that cause of so many early colonizing
failures. Food supplies diminished
with each passing day. The buildings
at Fort Caroline, renamed San Mateo
by the Spaniards, accidentally burned
down with all their contents shortly
after its capture. The other vessels
of the Spanish fleet, scattered by the
storm while crossing the Atlantic,
failed to arrive with expected supplies
and reinforcements. To relieve the
situation Men&eacute;ndez decided to go to
Cuba for aid. On his way down the
coast he picked up the remaining
French survivors, who were too few
to prove a threat and were kindly
treated.</p>
<p>At Cuba jealousy and intrigue still
dogged his footsteps. The officials of
the <i>Casa</i>, by whom he had been imprisoned
in Spain, seem to have succeeded
in injuring his prestige and
reputation. He was coolly received
by the Governor of Cuba, Garc&iacute;a
Osario, and refused aid. The belated
arrival of several of his ships enabled
him to send his Florida posts some
relief. On his way back he visited
the Indians of Carlos, or Caloosa Indians,
who then occupied south Florida.
They made a practice of enslaving
shipwrecked Spaniards who fell
into their hands, sacrificing some of
these victims in their pagan rites.
Men&eacute;ndez found several Spanish survivors
among them, but looked in
vain for the familiar features of his
son, Don Juan.</p>
<p>During his extended absence from
St. Augustine dissension broke out
among his followers. When a vessel
arrived with supplies mutineers seized
it and prepared to sail away. A similar
situation developed at San Mateo.
Many had joined the expedition only
because they expected it might lead
to easy riches. Failure to find any
signs of gold and silver in Florida
proved a bitter disappointment. Or,
they had secretly planned to desert it
at the first opportunity, and seek
passage to other Spanish colonies from
which fabulous wealth flowed to Spain.
Now that the French had been defeated
there was little glory to be
gained in the hardships of fort building,
and threatened starvation in this distant
wilderness. A number of the mutineers
eventually embarked for the Caribbean,
and thence some went to Spain, where
they circulated damaging reports of
Men&eacute;ndez and the Florida settlements.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><i>Gunpowder Versus Arrows</i></h3>
<p>The Indians meanwhile, though at
first outwardly friendly, became an
increasing threat to the new colony.
Spanish mutineers at San Mateo inflamed
their hatred by the unprovoked
murder of three of their chiefs. They
held a great council and declared their
enmity.</p>
<p>Huddled within their stockades, the
Spaniards could not venture out in
search of food without fear of attack.
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
The savages lurked everywhere in the
swamps and woodlands, and shot their
arrows with such force as to penetrate
a soldier&rsquo;s coat of mail. The crude
firearms of the day were not entirely
suited to Indian warfare. When a
Spaniard paused to reload his slow-firing
arquebus, an operation requiring
several minutes, Indians rose from their
hiding to shower him with arrows.
When they saw the flash of burning
powder in the primer of his gun, they
crawled through the tall grass and
appeared in another place after it had
been discharged. Over one hundred
Spaniards were thus killed by the Indians
during the first year of the
colony&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="525" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A Le Moyne drawing, showing Florida Indians attacking a rival village
with flaming arrows.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Indian attacks became so serious as
to cause the removal of the settlement
to another site. One night, when
Men&eacute;ndez was absent on an exploring
trip, yelling savages broke through the
Spanish lines at St. Augustine, and
set fire to the storehouse with flaming
arrows, destroying precious powder and
supplies.</p>
<p>When Men&eacute;ndez returned he called
a council of his officers. &ldquo;It was
resolved that they should move from
there and erect a fort at the entrance
of the bar ... because there the
Indians could not do them so much
harm ... and there they could better
defend themselves against the vessels
of enemies that might want to enter
the harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Working in shifts, the Spaniards
rushed the construction of a stockade
and fort at the new location.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>During the summer of 1566, the
lonely Florida settlers were heartened
by the arrival of substantial reinforcements.
A fleet of fourteen vessels
under Sancho de Arciniega brought
1,500 persons and welcome supplies.
Part of this force was assigned to
bolster the Florida garrisons. Men&eacute;ndez
was ordered to employ the remainder
against pirates, or corsairs,
who were plundering Spanish shipping
and colonies in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>By this time, in accordance with the
terms of his contract. Men&eacute;ndez had
established three fortified posts in Florida&mdash;St.
Augustine in about its present
location, San Mateo near the mouth
of the St. Johns River, and Santa Elena
still farther north on the coast of
Carolina. He had thoroughly explored
the Florida coasts, and gone up the
St. Johns River almost to its source.
He had traveled among the Indians
of South Florida, and of <i>Guale</i>, or
southeastern Georgia, endeavoring to
win their friendship and subject them
to Spanish authority. One of his lieutenants,
Juan Pardo, had penetrated
inland with a few soldiers a distance
of 450 miles to the mountains of western
North Carolina. Possibly always
in the back of his mind lurked the
hope that he might come upon some
news of his lost son and once more
embrace him in his arms.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><i>Men&eacute;ndez Goes to Spain</i></h3>
<p>In 1567 Men&eacute;ndez deemed it necessary
that he go back to Spain to render
in person a report on the condition
and needs of the Florida and West
Indian colonies. The little garrison
at St. Augustine continued to cling
precariously to its narrow beach-head.
In the spring of 1568 the settlement
shuddered when a small French force
under Dominique de Gourges, aided
by Indians, wiped out the Spanish
posts near the mouth of the St. Johns.
Captured Spaniards were hanged from
the limbs of the liveoaks in revenge for
the Frenchmen killed at Fort Caroline
and Matanzas three years before.</p>
<h3 id="c13"><i>On the Brink of Failure</i></h3>
<p>During Men&eacute;ndez&rsquo; continued absence
in Spain, the condition and
morale of Florida posts grew
steadily worse. Supplies were dangerously
low, clothing was worn to shreds,
and the shelters thus far constructed
afforded little comfort. Efforts to
grow corn and other grains in the
sandy soil resulted in discouraging
failure.</p>
<p>The summer of 1570 brought no
relief. The blazing sun scorched the
beaches and swamps. Mosquitos and
other insects made life miserable. Est&eacute;ban
de las Alas, one of Men&eacute;ndez&rsquo;
trusted lieutenants in charge of the
post at Santa Elena, sailed with 120
men for Spain, arguing that those remaining
would have a better chance
for survival on the limited supplies.
The garrison at St. Augustine mutinied,
burned its fort, and began building
a crude boat in which to leave.
The settlement of Florida hovered on
the brink of failure.</p>
<p>At this crucial point Don Pedro Men&eacute;ndez
Marqu&eacute;s assumed command.
He was a nephew of the founder and
had served with him in the treasure
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
fleets. In a letter written from San
Mateo, he pleaded with the mutineers
at St. Augustine to remain at their
post, promising to transport them to
Cuba if supplies failed to arrive by a
specified time. His arguments prevailed
and St. Augustine lived on.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><i>Death of Men&eacute;ndez</i></h3>
<p>Events in Europe continued to keep
Men&eacute;ndez occupied in Spain, or on
voyages to the Caribbean, during which
he again visited his Florida
posts. The Low Countries, Holland
and Belgium, which had long been
under Spanish domination, were in
revolt.</p>
<p>In 1574 Men&eacute;ndez received the
crowning honor of his career. He
was chosen by Philip II of Spain to
take command of a great armada of
ships and men being assembled in the
harbor of Santander, presumably for
operation against the Low Countries,
and possibly the English coast. On the
day he assumed this important command
he fell ill with a raging fever.
The usual remedies of purging and
blood-letting proved of no avail, and
he died on September 17, 1574, at the
age of 55.</p>
<p>The day before the beginning of his
fatal illness he wrote a letter to his
nephew, Marqu&eacute;s, expressing his desire
to return to Florida, and stating that
he hoped to do so in the spring, when
he was confident the affair in Flanders
would be settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I shall be at
liberty to go at once to Florida, never
to leave it as long as I live, for that
is my longing and my happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Storms prevented burial in his native
Avil&eacute;s, to which his remains were later
removed. There an inscription on his
tomb eulogizes him as &ldquo;the illustrious
Adelantado of the Province of Florida
... and Captain-General of the
Oceanic Seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His death was a blow to Spain. No
outstanding naval figure arose to take
his place, and the great armada he
was to have commanded never sailed.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />The Years Accumulate</h2>
<p>It was the following spring of 1575
before the news of Men&eacute;ndez&rsquo;
death reached Florida. St. Augustine,
now ten years old, had lost not
only its founder and a resourceful leader,
but was left without his financial
support. As he had spent his entire fortune
in establishing the Florida posts,
his heirs were in no position to assume
the obligation of sustaining them.</p>
<p>Influential advisors in Spain urged
that the settlement of Florida be abandoned,
because the province produced
no gold, silver, or other riches. King
Philip II weighed the problem carefully.
He decreed that the Florida
posts should continue to be maintained,
because of their value in protecting the
vital trade route along the coast, and
as a refuge for shipwrecked mariners
and vessels in distress. Since the heirs
of Men&eacute;ndez could not finance them,
they would be made crown colonies
under the supervision of the King, and
would be supported by an annual
<i>Situado</i> or subsidy, which the Viceroy
of New Spain (Mexico) was ordered
to provide.</p>
<p>Hernando de Miranda, a son-in-law
of Men&eacute;ndez, became the next <i>Adelantado</i>
and governor of Florida. In
the face of Indian difficulties he abandoned
the fort at Santa Elena and was
removed from office. As his successor
the king appointed Don Pedro Men&eacute;ndez
Marqu&eacute;s, who had saved St. Augustine
from abandonment in 1570,
and was a man of proven ability. He
remained governor of Florida for the
next twelve years, from 1577 to 1589.</p>
<p>Spain was at the peak of its wealth
and power, but England under Queen
Elizabeth was becoming bold and a
growing menace on the seas.</p>
<h3 id="c16"><i>First English Visit</i></h3>
<p>The passing years rooted St. Augustine
more firmly to its soil. The
spring of 1586 brought fresh green to
the grass and trees, a warmth and
fragrance to the air. Mocking birds
and bright red cardinals sang gaily
from the branches. The settlement
was twenty-one years old when a vessel
arrived bearing news that Spain and
England were at war, and that Sir
Francis Drake, the dreaded English
corsair, was raiding Spanish colonies in
the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Governor Marqu&eacute;s took immediate
steps to prepare St. Augustine&rsquo;s defenses.
Slaves and soldiers labored in
cutting and hauling logs from the forest
to complete the new fort then under
construction. Detailed plans were made
for the evacuation of the families and
removal of supplies. Sentinels scanned
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the horizon with more than usual care.
The month of May wore on into June
and it was hoped that the English fleet
had sailed on by.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="765" height="678" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Map drawn by one of the participants in Drake&rsquo;s attack on St. Augustine

</div>
<p class="center"><b>EXPVGNATIO CIVITATIS S. AVGVSTINI IN AMERICA SIT&AElig;.</b></p>
<p>On June 6th (Spanish calendar),
the lookout stationed in the tall watch
tower on Anastasia Island saw white
specks appear on the horizon. They
grew into sails and he signalled a warning
to the settlement across the bay.
Soldiers rushed to their battle stations.
Housewives crossed themselves and
whispered their <i>Ave Marias</i> with
frightened children clinging to their
skirts. Slaves began removing supplies,
but in the confusion much was left
behind.</p>
<p>The powerful English fleet of Sir
Drake, heavy with plunder
from the Caribbean, drew closer and
came to anchor in the roadstead outside
the inlet. The Spaniards counted over
twenty large ships and their auxiliary
craft. The estimated 2,000 men aboard
hopelessly outnumbered St. Augustine&rsquo;s
little garrison of barely 150 defenders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The Spanish lookout tower on Anastasia
Island as described by a member
of Drake&rsquo;s expedition.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The English, having sighted the
settlement&rsquo;s lookout tower, decided to
investigate what manner of place the
Spanish King had here. A detachment
soon landed on Anastasia Island and
marched around the shore where, one
of their number relates, &ldquo;We might
discerne on the other side of the river
over against us a Fort which had been
newly built by the Spaniards; and some
mile or thereabouts above the Fort a
little Towne or village without walles:
built of wooden houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later the English landed cannon and
about dusk of the second day opened
fire. Governor Marqu&eacute;s and his garrison,
according to his report, clung
bravely to their fort until they saw
boats put out from the opposite shore.
After firing a few shots they retired
barely in time to escape capture. During
the night a Frenchman, held prisoner by
the Spaniards, went over to the English
camp and informed them of the garrison&rsquo;s
withdrawal. They occupied the
fort, finding in it some fourteen large
brass cannon and a chest of money
intended for the pay of the soldiers.</p>
<p>In the morning the English advanced
into the town. The English sergeant-major,
a man of considerable rank and
importance, mounted a deserted horse
and rode hotly in pursuit of some fleeing
Spaniards. He drove one of them
to the edge of a swamp and wounded
him with his lance. Mustering all his
strength, the wounded Spaniard turned
upon his assailant and killed him. The
English version relates that the officer
was shot from ambush, and on falling
to the ground was stabbed to death by
several Spaniards. Possibly due to this
incident, Drake ordered the fort and
town of St. Augustine burned to the
ground. After remaining a few days
in the vicinity to careen one of their
ships, the English sailed away.</p>
<p>When the people of St. Augustine
returned, smoke still curled from the
ruins of their fort and homes. Even
their fruit trees had been destroyed
by the invader. Governor Marqu&eacute;s
sent word of the disaster to Havana.
St. Augustine gradually arose from its
ashes, rebuilt and somewhat improved
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
with assistance from Spain and Cuba.
The post at Santa Elena was at this
time permanently abandoned in order
to strengthen St. Augustine&rsquo;s garrison.</p>
<h3 id="c17"><i>Saving of Savage Souls</i></h3>
<p>King Philip II of Spain, Men&eacute;ndez
and their successors burned with zeal
to convert the natives of Florida to
Catholicism, and regarded this as a
sacred obligation. After Drake&rsquo;s attack,
a friary or monastery was erected
at St. Augustine to shelter the Franciscan
missionaries who were beginning
to arrive from Spain to work among
the Indians. The friary was located
on what is now St. Francis Street on
the site of the present State Arsenal.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="Spanish missionary." width="388" height="600" />
</div>
<p>Other missionaries of the Jesuit Order
had come before them, but in the
face of the early antagonism of the
Indians they were able to accomplish
little. Jesuit missions had been established
as far north as the Chesapeake
Bay region of Virginia, in the vicinity
of Tampa Bay, and at <i>Tequesta</i>, near
the present site of Miami. In about
1570 the Jesuits were replaced by missionaries
of the Order of St. Francis,
or Franciscans.</p>
<p>The presence of Franciscans in Florida
is recorded as early as 1573, but
for a number of years they made only
limited progress. The courageous friars
endured many hardships and privations
in attempting to carry the peaceful
message of Christ deep into the Florida
wilderness, where they lived alone far
from civilized comforts and companionship.
Some suffered torture and
martyrdom at the hands of those they
sought to save, but all went resolutely
forth from St. Augustine eager to reap
a glorious harvest of savage souls.</p>
<p>The first Franciscan missions were
established along the coast north of
St. Augustine, where they could be
reached readily by boat. If the Indians
proved tractable and friendly, a crude
chapel was built and the peal of a
mission bell went out over swamp and
woodland calling them to prayer.</p>
<p>By 1595 the Franciscans claimed a
total of 1,500 Indian converts. Two
years later their success was interrupted
by an Indian revolt incited by a young
chief, who had been publicly censured
for his desire to have more than one
wife. Five Franciscans were clubbed
or tomahawked to death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>

</div>
<p class="center"><i><b><span class="large">The Glorious Harvest of Savage Souls</span></b></i></p>
<p>One of the highlights in the early
religious annals of Florida was its first
visitation by a Bishop in 1606. Bishop
Altamirano arrived at St. Augustine
from Cuba shortly before Easter. Impressive
religious ceremonies followed
with candles burning brightly on the
flower-decked altars. On Easter Saturday
the Bishop ordained twenty
young men as clerics, some of them
natives of the settlement. On Easter
Sunday he celebrated Mass and confirmed
350 Spaniards. After a week&rsquo;s
rest, the Bishop made a leisurely tour
of the outlying Franciscan missions,
confirming a total of 2,000 Indian
converts.</p>
<p>Each year this peaceful conquest
of Florida continued to expand, and
by the middle of 1600&rsquo;s extended into
north central Florida, a region known
as Apalache, in the vicinity of present
Tallahassee. This was a rich agricultural
area and at times furnished St.
Augustine with supplies, which were
brought around the peninsula by boat,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
or were carried overland on the backs
of Indians to the capital. The missions
also embraced a large section of <i>Guale</i>,
or southeastern Georgia. When Bishop
Calderon visited Florida in 1674-75,
a remarkable total of 13,152 Indian
converts were presented to him for confirmation.</p>
<p>Aside from its religious significance,
the missionary movement had other far-reaching
effects. Through the missions
St. Augustine, with its relatively small
garrison, was able to control a wide
territory, holding the numerically
strong Indian tribes in check. It was
said that a lone Franciscan, with no
weapons other than his Cross and Bible,
could do more with the Indians than
a hundred men at arms. The missions
also served as outlying posts that could
warn the capital of approaching
strangers or enemies. When the abandonment
of the settlement was again
seriously considered in 1602, the existence
of the missions proved a strong
argument in favor of maintaining St.
Augustine as their protective center.</p>
<p>While the Franciscan missions of
Florida were more numerous and of
earlier origin than those of California,
they have received little emphasis, possibly
because they were built of wood
and no physical evidence of them remains.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h3 id="c18"><i>Another Crisis</i></h3>
<p>In 1598 death brought to an end
the long reign of that remarkable sovereign
of Spain, Philip II. He had
initiated the settlement of Florida, and
later as a crown colony it had come
under his supervision. When news of
his passing reached Florida in March
of 1599, the Franciscans gathered at
St. Augustine to hold the customary
prayers for their departed patron. The
same month the cry of &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; rang
out in the quiet streets. Flames raced
through the tinder-dry palm-thatched
roofs of the town&rsquo;s buildings, destroying
many, including the Franciscan
quarters. In the fall of the same year
a storm did considerable damage. The
wind-driven waters of the bay rose
higher with each tide, flooding dwellings
and washing away a portion of
the fort.</p>
<p>Philip III, who ascended the throne
of Spain in 1598, failed to share his
father&rsquo;s interest in this distant Florida
post, from which no riches flowed into
the royal coffers. From it came only
constant pleas for more assistance.</p>
<p>The King ordered Pedro de Vald&eacute;s,
the Governor of Cuba, to make a thorough
investigation of conditions in
Florida. Vald&eacute;s sent his son to St.
Augustine in 1602 to hold hearings,
in which missionaries and settlers of
long residence testified. While many
of these witnesses expressed the view
that a more favorable location for a
settlement might be found, the conclusion
reached was that St. Augustine
should continue to be maintained as a
center for the expanding missions, and
as a base to guard the vital trade route.</p>
<p>The passing years were being added
slowly to its age. Deaths, births, marriages,
Indian insurrections, the coming
of new governors, and the arrival
of an occasional ship made up the
drama of its obscure existence. Isolated
by a wilderness of land and sea, it
had little contact with the outside
world.</p>
<h3 id="c19"><i>Capital of La Florida</i></h3>
<p>About 1590 the older portion of St.
Augustine was laid out in approximately
its present form. The plan
followed specifications contained in a
<i>c&eacute;dula</i> issued by the Spanish King in
1573, directing that all Spanish colonial
towns should have a central Plaza
with the principal streets leading from
it. During about the same period an
official governor&rsquo;s residence was established
on the site of the present
post office.</p>
<p>Women were present in the colony
from the beginning, a few having come
with the original Men&eacute;ndez expedition.
Others arrived with the Arciniega reinforcements
and later fleets. Some
of the soldiers married Indian maidens,
who had become Christians and been
given Spanish names.</p>
<p>The governors complained of the
problem of feeding the increasing number
of children in the colony, and asked
that the married soldiers be given extra
pay. The yellowed pages of St. Augustine&rsquo;s
Cathedral Parish records,

<p>The principal officers of the colony
consisted of the governor, who was its
chief executive; the royal treasurer, who
was custodian of the royal funds and
their disbursement; and the <i>factor</i>, who
distributed the supplies. A sergeant-major
was in command of the infantry
and succeeded the governor in case of
the latter&rsquo;s death or resignation. A
minor but important official, from the
standpoint of historians, was the
<i>Escribano</i> (writer), who kept a record

took the testimony of witnesses,
and acted as a notary public.</p>
<p>The governors of Florida were appointed
by the King in distant Spain
from a list of candidates proposed by
the Council of the Indies. They were
usually men of previous military experience,
and served generally for a
term of six years. When a new governor
arrived at St. Augustine to take
office, Indian chiefs trooped in from
the outlying districts to pledge their
friendship and allegiance. They were
entertained as elaborately as the resources
of the settlement would permit,
given trinkets and food for the long
journey home. Although relatively
small in size, St. Augustine was the
capital and citadel of a vast area. La
Florida then as claimed by Spain embraced
not only the present peninsula,
but the entire Atlantic coast as far
north as Canada and as far inland
as the continent was known to exist.
For a time after the expulsion of the
French Huguenots, no other European
nation seriously challenged this claim,
but the clouds of strife were beginning
to appear.</p>

<br />The English Threat</h2>
<p>St. Augustine remained the sole
European settlement in what is
now the continental United States
for a period of forty-two years. About
the time of its attack by Drake in 1586
it received vague but disturbing reports
of the presence of English settlers to
the north in a region known to the
Spaniards as <i>Jac&aacute;n</i>, or the Chesapeake
Bay region of Virginia. This was the
ill-fated Roanoke colony. It was followed
in 1607 by the founding of
Jamestown, Virginia, by the English,
which represented a further violation
of territory claimed by Spain as a part
of Florida. Three expeditions, one in
1588 and others in 1609 and 1611, set
out from St. Augustine to reconnoiter
these rival settlements.</p>
<p>The Virginia colony survived and
others crept down the coast in defiance
of Spain&rsquo;s claims to the territory. The
Spanish governors at St. Augustine repeatedly
implored authorities in Spain
to strengthen Florida&rsquo;s garrison and
defenses to meet this English threat.
But the mother country, almost constantly
involved in wars with European
rivals, or vexed with internal problems,
took no decisive action.</p>
<p>In 1665 St. Augustine became one
hundred years of age. As if to celebrate
its centennial, the English King Charles
II, issued a second patent opening up
the territory south of Virginia to English
settlement. This patent not only
disregarded Spanish claims to the area,
but even included within its boundaries
the very site of St. Augustine itself.</p>
<h3 id="c21"><i>A Midnight Raid</i></h3>
<p>In the spring of 1668, during the
delightful month of May, the appearance
of a vessel off St. Augustine&rsquo;s inlet
caused a ripple of excitement. The
settlement was awaiting a shipment of
flour from Veracruz, Mexico, and a
payment on its subsidy then eight years
in arrears. The harbor pilot put out
to bring the vessel across the treacherous
bar. Soon two cannon shot were
heard, a prearranged signal identifying
the vessel as the one expected. The
people were elated and retired confidently
for the night.</p>
<p>But the ship was not manned by
friends as was assumed. It had been
seized by an English pirate, Robert
Searles (alias Davis), in the vicinity
of Cuba. When the vessel arrived off
St. Augustine the Spanish captain and
crew were compelled upon threat of
death to appear on deck as if nothing
were amiss. The unsuspecting harbor
pilot was tricked into firing the identifying
signal and made prisoner before
he could warn the settlement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The boundaries of Florida grew
smaller.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Around midnight, when the town
was peacefully sleeping, the pirate band
rowed stealthily ashore undetected, and
scattered through the streets. The people
emerged from their homes expecting
to greet friends, but their joy soon
turned to anguished cries of terror.
Many were killed by the pirates in attempting
to resist or flee half-clad to
safety. In the darkness it was difficult
to distinguish friend from foe. With
shouting pirates at their heels, the
governor and part of the garrison managed
to reach their fort and beat off
attempts to take it.</p>
<p>The next morning the pirates systematically
looted the homes and churches,
and a previously hidden pirate ship
appeared in the bay. Unable to take
the fort, the invaders left their captives
on the beach and sailed away under the
cover of darkness. St. Augustine&rsquo;s residents
returned to find sixty of their
comrades dead in the blood-stained
streets.</p>
<h3 id="c22"><i>A Stone Fort at Last</i></h3>
<p>The founding of Charleston, S. C.,
in 1670 brought the English threat
still nearer. An expedition sailed from
St. Augustine to attack the new settlement
but ran into a severe storm and
failed to reach its objective.</p>
<p>The success of the pirate raid on
St. Augustine in 1668, combined with
the growing English encroachment on
Spanish territory to the north, finally
convinced officials in Spain that something
must be done to bolster Florida&rsquo;s
defenses. In the fall of 1669, Queen
Regent Marianna of Spain issued a
<i>c&eacute;dula</i> directing the Viceroy of Mexico
to provide funds for the construction
of an impregnable stone fortress at
St. Augustine, similar to the bastions
guarding Spanish strongholds in the
Caribbean. All previous forts in Florida
had been of wood and soon rotted
in the moist sea air. The new fort
would be built of coquina, a shell-rock
formation, found in abundance on Anastasia
Island across the bay from the
capital. Several earlier Florida governors
had urged its use without success.</p>
<p>Florida&rsquo;s next governor, Manuel
Cendoya, went at once to Mexico to
collect the funds appropriated to begin
the new defense work. At Havana,
Cuba, he engaged the services of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
competent military engineer, Ignazio
Daza, to plan and supervise its initial
stages.</p>
<p>Work on the new structure began
during the fall of 1672. Stone masons
and other skilled artisans were brought
from Cuba. Quarries were opened on
Anastasia Island. Gangs of Indian
workmen and yokes of oxen dragged
the heavy coquina blocks to the water&rsquo;s
edge, where they were loaded on rafts
or barges, and ferried across the bay
to the fort site.</p>
<p>The massive walls rose slowly. After
an enthusiastic beginning progress
lagged at times for want of funds, lack
of vigorous prosecution, or when epidemics
thinned the ranks of slaves and
Indian workmen. In the spring of 1683
it was interrupted by a threatened attack,
one of many to which St. Augustine
was continually subjected. English
pirates landed near Matanzas Inlet,
burned the Spanish outpost there, and
advanced toward the capital. Warned
by alert sentinels, the governor sent
out a detachment of musketeers, who
waited in ambush and drove the raiders
back to their ships.</p>
<p>By 1696 the great stone fort was
about completed except for some of
the outer work, added during later
periods. Into its construction went
twenty-four long years of sweat and
toil beneath the Florida sun, and the
lives of an untold number of slaves,
Indian, and peon workmen. It was
called by the Spaniards <i>Castillo de San
Marcos</i>, or castle of St. Mark&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="615" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The grim walls of Castillo de San Marcos look much the same as when
the stones were lifted laboriously into place.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h3 id="c23"><i>Settlement of Pensacola</i></h3>
<p>While the English were occupying
the Atlantic Coast north of Florida,
hardy French traders and explorers,
including the Jesuit, La Salle, came
down the Mississippi River building
forts at strategic points. This threatened
Florida on the west. To meet the
French threat to the Gulf coast, the
Spaniards under Andr&eacute;s de Arriola established
a fort and settlement at Pensacola
in 1698, which later was to
become the capital of West Florida.
A previous Spanish attempt by Trist&aacute;n
de Luna to establish a settlement near
this point in 1559 had failed.</p>
<h3 id="c24"><i>Border Conflict</i></h3>
<p>Strife between the Spaniards in
Florida and their English neighbors to
the north did not at first break out
into open warfare. English agents and
traders began to work quietly among
the border Indians, weaning some of
them away from Spanish control and
influence. These they then armed and
encouraged to raid the Spanish Indian
towns. Christian Indians captured by
the English and their Indian allies
were sold into slavery. Florida&rsquo;s Governor
Cabrera (1680-1687) complained
that they even seized the
&ldquo;mixed ones,&rdquo; children of Spanish and
Indian parentage. Small bands of Yamassee
Indians, then allied with the
English, hovered about St. Augustine,
occasionally seizing a stray Spaniard,
whom they carried back to Carolina.
The Carolinians even offered the Indians
a reward for captured Spaniards
delivered to them upon the pretense
that it was to save the victims from
torture.</p>
<p>By 1686, with its Castillo about
completed, St. Augustine felt ready
to take the offensive. In the fall of
that year its women waved farewell
to soldier husbands and sweethearts.
They sailed north in three ships, destroyed
a Scottish settlement at Port
Royal, plundered English coastal plantations,
and advanced on <i>San Jorge</i>, as
the Spaniards called it, or Charleston.
Suddenly a hurricane came up driving
two of their vessels hopelessly aground.
The third limped sadly back to Matanzas
Bay.</p>
<p>Soon after this expedition a boat-load
of half-starved Negro slaves arrived
at St. Augustine, and asked for
the Holy Waters of Baptism. They
had escaped from Carolina plantations.
In response to demands for their return
the Spanish governor offered to
reimburse the English for their loss.
Spanish agents and Indians secretly
began to encourage slaves in Carolina
to run away, making it known that
St. Augustine offered them asylum.
These refugees increased in number
and were allowed to occupy lands two
miles north of the settlement in the
vicinity of Mose Creek.</p>
<h3 id="c25"><i>The Shipwrecked Quakers</i></h3>
<p>John Archdale, a Quaker, became
governor of Carolina in 1695. He
frowned upon the enslavement of
Christian Indians and returned four
to authorities at St. Augustine, who
wrote him a letter of appreciation and
agreed to reciprocate by according English
subjects safe conduct through Spanish
territory. This accounts for the
kind treatment accorded a small company
of Quakers enroute to Philadelphia,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
who were wrecked on the coast
of Florida in the vicinity of Hobe
Sound in 1696. The Quakers reached
shore safely only to suffer torturing
hardship among the coastal Indians,
who feared Spanish authority but were
still savages in most respects.</p>

<p>After two months of harrowing
captivity the Quakers were rescued by
a Captain L&oacute;pez and detail of soldiers
from St. Augustine. They were brought
to the settlement and later escorted
safely to the English border. One of
their number, Jonathan Dickinson,
wrote and published a book of their
adventures, which contains an interesting
description of St. Augustine and
Florida as these Quakers saw them so
many years ago.</p>
<p>As the Quakers were brought up
the coast they noted the chain of
Spanish sentinel posts south of St. Augustine,
which were located on high
dunes overlooking the sea, beach and
river. By means of smoke signals, or
Indian runners, they could quickly
warn the capital of danger.</p>
<p>The little Quaker band was hospitably
received at the settlement and
quartered among its inhabitants. &ldquo;This
place is a Garrison,&rdquo; wrote Dickinson,
&ldquo;maintained one-half by the King of
Spain and one-half by the Church of
Rome. The male inhabitants are all
soldiers, everyone receiving his pay
according to his post. All of their
supply of Bread, Clothing and Money
comes from Havana and Porta Vella,
and it was going on three years since
they had a Vessel from any place whatsoever,
which made their needs very
great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Towne we saw from one end
to the other. It is about three-quarters
of a mile in Length, not regularly
built, nor the Houses very thick (close
together), they having large orchards,
in which grow plenty of oranges, lemons,
pome citrons, limes, figs, and
peaches. The Houses are most of them
old buildings, and not half of them
inhabited, the number of men being
around three hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their way north to Charleston
the Quakers stopped overnight at several
Spanish Indian towns, where Dickinson
noted that &ldquo;the Indians go as consistently
to their devotion, at all times
and at all seasons, as do the Spaniards.&rdquo;
He also observed that the Indian
women modestly clothed themselves
with the moss of trees (Spanish moss),
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
&ldquo;making Gownes and Petticoats thereof,
which at a distance or at night
looks very neat.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c26"><i>The Castle&rsquo;s First Test</i></h3>
<p>Castillo de San Marcos, completed
in 1696, had not yet undergone an
attack. It was soon to come. In
Europe the War of Spanish Succession
(1700-1713) involved England in a
conflict with Spain and France that
soon spread to their colonies, where it
was known as Queen Anne&rsquo;s War.
Governor Moore of Carolina obtained
the backing of its colonial assembly for
an expedition against Spain&rsquo;s citadel in
Florida. He recruited a force of some
600 Carolina militia and a number of
Indian allies. They advanced south
in two detachments during the fall of
1702. Florida&rsquo;s Governor Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga
learned of the impending attack in time
to lay in adequate provisions and put
his garrison on a 24-hour alert.</p>
<p>Colonel Daniel with one Carolina
detachment came up the St. Johns
River and thence overland. Moore
with the other came down the coast in
eight small vessels. Daniel arrived
first and advanced upon St. Augustine
by land. Governor Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga had few
experienced soldiers, and did not try
to save the town. All of its inhabitants
were ordered into the fort, which soon
sheltered some 1,500 people.</p>
<p>Moore soon arrived by sea with a
quantity of trench-digging tools and
fifteen long ladders for scaling the
fort&rsquo;s walls. But the English had
greatly underestimated the Castillo&rsquo;s
strength and found there was little
hope of taking it with their few small
calibre guns. Colonel Daniel was sent
to Jamaica to secure siege guns and
bombs.</p>
<p>During the siege the Spaniards made
two sallies from the fort to destroy
their own houses in its vicinity to prevent
them being used as cover by the
English. A total of 31 houses were
thus destroyed as shown by claims later
filed by their Spanish owners.</p>
<p>Almost two months of siege passed.
Within the overcrowded Castillo inhabitants
and garrison prayed for relief.
The day after Christmas two
heavily armed Spanish ships appeared
off the inlet bringing aid. Fearing their
retreat would be cut off, the Carolinians
burned their transports, abandoned
their heavy stores, set fire to the town,
and withdrew overland to vessels awaiting
them at the mouth of the St. Johns
River.</p>
<p>The Castillo had triumphed in its
first test, but the town of St. Augustine
was virtually reduced to ashes.
Spanish eyewitnesses testified that not
a building was left standing except the
<i>Hermitage of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la
Soledad</i>, and some twenty houses of
the meaner sort. These were probably
scattered dwellings south of the Plaza.</p>
<p>Although disgraced by the failure of
his expedition, Moore returned to Florida
in 1704 with a large number of
Indian allies. They overran the weakly
garrisoned Indian towns of Apalache
and the interior, taking 1,300
Indian prisoners back to Carolina. During
this and subsequent invasions practically
all of the outlying Franciscan
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
Missions were destroyed. Only those
in the immediate vicinity of St. Augustine
remained.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="796" height="566" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Two stout defense lines protected the capital on the north.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c27"><i>The Capital&rsquo;s Defenses</i></h3>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s siege of St. Augustine in
1702 showed a serious weakness in the
capital&rsquo;s defenses. The enemy were
able to occupy and burn the town
despite its impregnable Castillo. This
led to the gradual construction of a
system of outer defenses to protect the
town itself from future invasion.</p>
<p>First an inner defense line was built
extending westward from the Castillo
to the San Sebastian River along what
is now Orange Street. It eventually
consisted of a moat, some fifty or more
feet wide and six feet deep. Material
from the ditch was used to build a
sturdy wall of earth and palm logs.
St. Augustine&rsquo;s City Gate is all that
remains of this defense work.</p>
<p>Later a fortified line was constructed
extending across the peninsula between
the bay and the San Sebastian River,
&ldquo;about a cannon shot north of the
fort.&rdquo; It was called the <i>Hornwork</i>
because a portion of it resembled in
shape the horn of a steer. It consisted
of a wide ditch and embankment of
earth and sod, at one time further
strengthened by a stockade of logs,
and a fort at its eastern extremity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Another defense line extended north
and south along Maria Sanchez Creek
in the vicinity of present Cordova
Street, marking the western boundary
of the original settlement. Other defense
works protected it on the south.
The lines were strengthened at intervals
by redoubts and angular projections,
in some of which cannon were
mounted. Sentinels manned the defense
lines day and night, once each
hour passing the <i>Alerto</i>.</p>
<p>When escaped Negro slaves began to
find refuge in St. Augustine, a small
fort was built for their protection two
miles north of the town. It was called
Fort Mosa, or the Negro Fort, and
served as an anchor for another defense
line running east and west. Practically
no evidence of this fort and defense
work has survived.</p>
<h3 id="c28"><i>Palmer&rsquo;s Raid</i></h3>
<p>The Yamassee Indians of Carolina,
once allied with the English, turned
against them and in 1715 were decisively
defeated. The Spaniards in
Florida were accused of fomenting this
revolt. A remnant of the tribe took
refuge in the St. Augustine area where,
according to English reports, they were
welcomed by the ringing of bells. For
some reason the Yamassees were banished
for a time south of the city.
They were later recalled, given weapons,
and encouraged to make raids on
the Carolina border plantations, bringing
back bloody scalps and an occasional
prisoner.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="393" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A gun emplacement in the defense lines. The platform sloped forward to
absorb the gun&rsquo;s recoil.</i></p>
</div>
<p>To put an end to these raids a
Colonel Palmer swept south from
Carolina in 1728 with a small force of
militia and Indians. They surprised
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
and butchered some of the Yamassees
in their villages north of St. Augustine,
but could not penetrate its now
strong outer defense line. After destroying
everything of value outside the
city, and seizing many Spanish-owned
cattle, Palmer returned to Carolina.
Following his departure the Spanish
governor ordered the destruction of the
mission chapel of <i>Nombre de Dios</i>,
which had afforded the English cover
in their attack.</p>
<p>The settlement of Georgia in 1733
by General James Oglethorpe brought
the English still closer. Spanish authorities
sensed an impending crisis and
sent Antonio Arredondo, a competent
military engineer and diplomat, to St.
Augustine to negotiate with Oglethorpe
and survey Florida&rsquo;s defenses.
While Arredondo failed to persuade
the English to withdraw from Georgia,
under his able supervision St. Augustine&rsquo;s
fortifications were carefully
strengthened. Rooms inside the Castillo
were rebuilt with arched ceilings
of thick masonry to make them bombproof.
Backed by Arredondo&rsquo;s recommendations,
Florida&rsquo;s Governor
Montiano secured substantial reinforcements
from Cuba, increasing the garrison
to around 750 men.</p>
<h3 id="c29"><i>Oglethorpe&rsquo;s Siege</i></h3>
<p>Spanish regulations allowed her
colonies only limited trading privileges
with rival England, which had
become a great mercantile nation. To
prevent the prevalent smuggling of
illicit English goods into their ports,
Spanish ships were ordered to stop
and search English vessels off their
coasts.</p>
<p>One of the English merchantmen
overhauled off the coast of Florida or
Cuba was commanded by a Robert
Jenkins. He reported that the Spanish
captain, Juan de Le&oacute;n Fandi&ntilde;o,
cut off his ear and handed it back to
him saying, &ldquo;Carry this to your king
and tell him I would treat him in like
manner.&rdquo; Incidents such as this caused
rising indignation in both countries.
The severed ear, or a substitute, was
later displayed by Jenkins before the
English Parliament, and gave its name
to the war that England declared
against Spain in 1739, the War of
Jenkins&rsquo; Ear.</p>
<p>General Oglethorpe of Georgia was
ordered to harass the Spaniards in
Florida, and proceeded to organize an
expedition designed to capture St. Augustine.
During the winter be probed
Spanish defenses, seizing Fort Picolata
on the St. Johns River west of the
capital, and a companion fort across
the river from it. In early May of
1740 he moved south with 400 of his
Georgia regiment and took Fort Diego,
a Spanish plantation post fifteen miles
north of St. Augustine, in the vicinity
of present Palm Valley. Leaving troops
to hold it, he then retired back to
the mouth of the St. Johns River to
await the arrival of his other military
contingents.</p>
<p>During early April six half galleys
from Cuba slipped into St. Augustine&rsquo;s
Matanzas Bay in response to Governor
Montiano&rsquo;s frantic pleas for assistance.
They were commanded by the same
Juan de Le&oacute;n Fandi&ntilde;o, who is reputed
to have cut off Jenkins&rsquo; ear, and proved
an important factor in saving the city.</p>

<p>Oglethorpe&rsquo;s other military units
finally arrived and he moved south
over the land route from the St. Johns
River, and occupied Fort Mosa, two
miles north of the capital. In addition
to his Georgia regiment, he now
had a detachment of Carolina militia,
a company of Highlanders, some Indian
allies, and the assistance of an
English naval unit of four twenty-gun
ships and two sloops, a total force of
about 900.</p>
<p>His original plan of making a concerted
attack on the city from its land
approaches and waterfront was
thwarted. The inlet proved too shallow
for the English ships to enter and
provide a covering fire for the landing
of marines. The Spanish half galleys
received from Cuba effectively controlled
the bay. They were a small
maneuverable type of boat, propelled
by oars and sail, and mounted long
brass nine-pounders.</p>
<p>To attack from the north, the English
would be exposed to a murderous
fire from the Castillo and Cubo Line.
The only alternative was a siege that
might starve St. Augustine into submission.
Colonel Palmer, who had
raided the city in 1728, was assigned
to hold Fort Mosa with a hundred
Highlanders and a few Indians, and
prevent supplies from reaching St. Augustine
from the north. Colonel Vanderdusen,
with the Carolina detachment,
was stationed on Point Quartel,
north of the inlet. Guns were landed
on Anastasia Island and dragged into
position as near the fort and town as
the swampy terrain would permit. The
English naval unit tightly blockaded
the coast and inlets to prevent aid
from reaching St. Augustine by sea.
General Oglethorpe then boldly called
upon Governor Montiano to surrender.
The latter replied that he would be
glad to shake hands with his Excellency
within the castle&rsquo;s walls.</p>
<p>From their batteries across the bay,
the English began an intermittent bombardment
of the fort and town that
continued for some twenty-seven days.
The terrified inhabitants withdrew out
of range, greeting each enemy shot with
a chorus of <i>Ave Marias</i>.</p>
<p>On the night of June 26th, during a
lull in the bombardment, Spanish and
Negro troops crept out of the defense
lines, and at dawn fell upon the English
at Fort Mosa. Palmer and fifty
of his men were killed, and some taken
prisoner.</p>
<p>Within the city supplies were fast
diminishing. Governor Montiano sent
messengers to Cuba, stating that if aid
was not sent all at St. Augustine would
soon perish. On July 7th he received
encouraging word that two vessels from
Cuba had eluded the English blockade
and slipped into Mosquito Inlet, eighty
miles to the south. Pursued by the
English patrol, they managed to reach
Matanzas Inlet, and from that point
supplies were brought up the inland
waterway to relieve the beleaguered
city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The hot summer sun beat down on
the English camps across the bay.
Swarms of sandflies and mosquitoes tortured
the besiegers. Due to brackish
water from shallow wells and improper
food, many were ill. Groups of the
Carolina militia were daily deserting.
The commander of the English naval
unit informed Oglethorpe that he
would soon be forced to withdraw his
support, because of limited supplies and
the danger of storms. Faced by these
unfavorable circumstances, General
Oglethorpe raised the siege, crossed over
to the mainland, and began the long
trek back to Georgia.</p>
<p>The people of St. Augustine returned
jubilantly to their homes, which had
suffered little or no damage in the
bombardment. Chapels and churches
rang with <i>Te Deums</i> of thanksgiving.</p>
<h3 id="c30"><i>Further Hostilities</i></h3>
<p>St. Augustine had successfully
stemmed the English advance. Spain
further strengthened its garrison and
defenses. Spanish privateers, some of
them based at St. Augustine, preyed
upon English commerce and plantations
along the coast to the north.
During 1741 no less than thirty English
prizes were brought into Matanzas
Bay.</p>
<p>Oglethorpe momentarily expected the
Spanish to launch a return attack upon
Georgia. During June of 1742 a
Georgia scout boat discovered fifteen
sail in St. Augustine&rsquo;s harbor. Soon
more arrived, and a strong expedition
composed of units from St. Augustine
and Cuba set out for Georgia, with
Florida&rsquo;s Governor Montiano in command.
The attack was directed toward
Fort Frederica, which guarded the approaches
to Savannah. Landing on
St. Simon&rsquo;s Island, this superior Spanish
force was ambushed and defeated
in the Battle of Bloody Marsh, and
withdrew to its camp. Soon afterward
a Frenchman deserted the English and
went over to the Spaniards. Oglethorpe
contrived to send the Frenchman
a letter, in which he directed him to
lead the Spaniards to believe that the
English were weak, and to persuade
them to attack. As expected, the letter
fell into the hands of the Spanish commanders,
who were at a loss as to how
to interpret it. Much to Oglethorpe&rsquo;s
relief they decided to withdraw.</p>
<p>Encouraged by his success, Oglethorpe
returned to Florida next year.
Marching ninety-six miles in four days,
he appeared before St. Augustine with
a small detachment, keeping his main
force hidden in ambush. His ruse might
have succeeded, had he not captured in
his advance a small company of Spaniards
guarding some workmen. Their
failure to return alerted the garrison.
After a few days he withdrew, remarking
that &ldquo;the Spaniards are so meek
there is no provoking them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederica, which Oglethorpe had established
as a Georgia military stronghold
against the Spaniards, gradually
became a ghost town after peace was
restored in 1748. In the meantime
Oglethorpe returned to England and
never threatened St. Augustine or Florida
again. In England he became an
intimate of the great literary figures
of the day, and lived to the ripe old
age of 96.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The next twenty years might be
called St. Augustine&rsquo;s Golden Age
under Spain. Substantial coquina
houses and tastefully decorated chapels
lined its narrow streets. The inhabitants
lived in relative ease and comfort.
Social life was gay with colorful carnivals
and religious celebrations rivaling
those of Havana, Cuba. The
capital was now a city of three thousand
souls, and would soon be two
centuries old. Florida seemed held
firmly in the grip of Spain.</p>
<p>But English colonists to the north
now numbered almost one million and
one hundred thousand Frenchmen had
settled in Canada. The struggle for
power among European nations was to
decide St. Augustine&rsquo;s fate.</p>

<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />Under British Rule</h2>
<p>While St. Augustine lived on
in apparent security, ominous
events were taking place in the
world outside. England and France
fought the Seven Years&rsquo; War, toward
the end of which Spain allied itself with
France. Far to the north French Quebec
fell to English arms in 1759, and to
the south Havana, Cuba, on which St.
Augustine heavily depended, yielded to
an English fleet in 1762. Ministers of
the three nations gathered at Paris to
decide the terms of peace.</p>
<p>On March 16, 1763, a lieutenant
from the English sloop <i>Bonetta</i> came
ashore at St. Augustine with important
papers for the governor, who was astounded
by what he read. Under the
terms of the treaty just concluded,
Spain ceded Florida to England in exchange
for the return of Havana and
other territorial concessions.</p>
<p>St. Augustine&rsquo;s shocked residents
soon gathered around the proclamation
posted on the government house. It
specified they would be given eighteen
months in which to settle their affairs,
dispose of their property, and evacuate
Florida, unless they desired to become
subjects of the British Crown. The
very thought of remaining under English
rule violated their deep devotion
to King and Church. All prepared to
leave; only eight being designated to
remain in an official capacity.</p>
<p>Busy months followed. Homes were
stripped for their furnishings. Linens,
silver, clothing, and various personal
articles were packed into chests and
boxes. Tearful groups gathered at the
landing place to bid farewell to friends
and neighbors. Some residents were
able to sell their property to the English,
who were at first hard-pressed to
find accommodations, but much remained
unsold and was left in the
custody of Spanish agents until more
English buyers might appear. Some,
including that of the Church, was
deeded in trust to two friendly English
traders, John Gordon and Jesse Fish.</p>
<p>On July 30, 1763, Major Francis
Ogilvie arrived at St. Augustine with
an English regiment. English soldiers
in their bright red coats paraded brazenly
on the Plaza green, while remaining
Spaniards looked on in sullen resentment.
Governor Feli&uacute; and the last
of the Spanish families sailed on January
21, 1764. The departing Spaniards
took with them all of their movable
possessions including, it is said, the
bones of their former governor and the
remains of several of their Saints.</p>

<p>Records show that St. Augustine at
the time of the Spanish evacuation had
a population of 3,096&mdash;961 men, chiefly
soldiers and officials; 798 women,
and 1,337 children. The majority went
to Cuba and the West Indies to find
new homes. The English flag with
its cross of St. George waved over the
capital. The stout Castillo, the narrow
streets, and the name St. Augustine
remained.</p>
<h3 id="c32"><i>British Rule Begins</i></h3>
<p>St. Augustine became virtually deserted
except for the presence of the
English staff and garrison. Dust and
cobwebs soon covered the Spanish
shrines. Weeds and brush grew deep
in the yards of the vacated homes. As
time went on a few English families
began to move in, and English gentlemen
of wealth and standing arrived to
look over this new province which their
country had acquired.</p>
<p>On a hot August day of 1764 a salute
of the fort&rsquo;s guns greeted the arrival
of Colonel James Grant, who came
from London to serve as East Florida&rsquo;s
first English governor. He had earlier
led an expedition against French-held
Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh) and had
served in the Cherokee Indian wars in
Carolina.</p>
<p>Governor Grant brought to St. Augustine
all the picturesque qualities of
English colonial life. Handsomely attired
gentlemen moved about the streets
in their white stockings, silk or velvet
knee-breeches, and rich embroidered
coats with lace at the cuff. Grant&rsquo;s
distinguished Council included the aristocratic
Moultries from South Carolina,
Chief Justice William Drayton,
and the Episcopal clergyman, John
Forbes. Also across the scene moved
Frederick George Mulcaster, reputed
to be the natural brother of England&rsquo;s
King, George III.</p>
<p>Liberal grants of land were offered
by the British to attract colonists to
East Florida. Glowing accounts of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
agricultural possibilities were published
and circulated. Titled English gentlemen
and wealthy Carolina planters
secured grants of land in the vicinity of
the capital and along the St. Johns
River. The eccentric Denys Rolle established
a colony called Rollestown
near the present site of East Palatka,
where he planned to rehabilitate derelicts
from the streets of London.</p>
<p>By 1768 Governor Grant was able
to report encouraging progress: &ldquo;This
province, which was a desert when I
came into it, although inhabited by the
Spaniards two hundred years, will soon
be a fruitful country. It fills faster
with inhabitants than I could have well
expected, and there are already a number
of slaves at work on the different
plantations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In contrast with conditions under
Spanish rule, vessels began to sail from
St. Augustine with cargoes of indigo,
barrels of oranges, casks of orange juice,
lumber and naval stores. Grant made
various improvements to the governor&rsquo;s
residence, facing the Parade, or Plaza.
The Franciscan Monastery was converted
to serve as quarters for the garrison,
and later large new barracks were
erected along the bayfront south of it.
One of the churches left by the Spaniards
was taken over by the English,
and later remodelled by Lieutenant-Governor
Moultrie, with the addition
of a handsome clock and steeple. It
was called St. Peter&rsquo;s.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c33"><i>The New Smyrna Colony</i></h3>
<p>During Grant&rsquo;s administration, a
Doctor Andrew Turnbull and associates
of London secured a large grant
of land near Mosquito Inlet, some
eighty miles south of St. Augustine.
There they planned to establish a plantation
colony for the production of
indigo, for which the British government
offered an attractive bounty.
Turnbull named the place New Smyrna
in honor of his wife&rsquo;s native Smyrna,
where he had also spent some time.</p>
<p>After visiting East Florida to inspect
his landgrant, Turnbull returned to
Europe to recruit colonists from the
shores of the Mediterranean. He secured
some 200 from Greece, 110 from
Italy, and then went on to the Island
of Minorca, where several years of
drought had impoverished many of the
inhabitants. This island, one of the
Balearic group off the coast of Spain,
was then an English possession. At
its port of Mah&oacute;n more people than
expected flocked to join the projected
colony, bringing the total to around
1,400.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1768 eight vessels
brought these hopeful colonists to East
Florida, saddened by the death of almost
150 during the long crowded
voyage from the British base at Gibraltar.
As customary in those days,
these colonists bound themselves to
work for a period of seven or eight
years in return for their passage and
sustenance, after which they were to
receive parcels of land and freedom
from further obligation.</p>
<p>After touching at St. Augustine the
vessels proceeded to New Smyrna,
where crude shelters were built. Clearing
the land for cultivation, and in the
meantime feeding and clothing such a
large number of people proved more
difficult and expensive than anticipated.
Due in part to crude living conditions,
three hundred died during the first
winter. Soon after their arrival, some
of the Greeks and Italians broke into
the storehouse, fatally wounded an
overseer, and were on the point of sailing
for Cuba when intercepted by an
armed vessel sent from St. Augustine
to subdue them. The ringleaders were
later captured, brought to the capital,
tried, and three condemned to death.
One was pardoned on agreeing to act
as executioner for the other two.</p>
<p>Governor Grant, who fully supported
Turnbull and wanted to see his
New Smyrna colony thrive, returned to
England in 1771. He was temporarily
succeeded by Lieutenant-Governor
Moultrie. In 1774 Patrick Tonyn,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
an ardent and arbitrary Loyalist, arrived
from England to take over the
governorship of East Florida. Serious
friction developed between these officials
and a faction in East Florida that
included Turnbull, Chief Justice Drayton,
and others as to convening a representative
assembly, such as Virginia
and other English colonies in America
enjoyed. The &ldquo;inflamed faction,&rdquo; as
Tonyn termed them, questioned the
power of the governor and his Council
to rule arbitrarily in the absence of an
elected legislative body. They became
bitter personal and political rivals.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>A view from the Governor&rsquo;s window, looking toward Matanzas Bay, about
where the Bridge of Lions stands today. From a drawing in the British
archives made in 1764.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In 1776 Chief Justice Drayton and
Turnbull sailed for London to seek
redress and answer Tonyn&rsquo;s charges.
During Turnbull&rsquo;s absence, the surviving
New Smyrna colonists, who now
numbered barely 600 out of the 1,400
who had left their Mediterranean
homes, secretly sent a delegation to St.
Augustine. They demanded release
from their contracts and reported being
cruelly treated by their overseers. Assured
of Governor Tonyn&rsquo;s sympathy
and protection, all of the surviving
colonists&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;later
marched in a body up the King&rsquo;s
Road to St. Augustine. Turnbull returned
from London in the fall of
1777 to find himself and his New
Smyrna colony ruined.</p>
<p>At St. Augustine the refugees were
assigned lands north of the City Gates,
where they built crude shelters and
managed to eke out a living by fishing,
hunting, and gardening. Time proved
them a self-reliant, industrious people,
who gradually attained more comfortable
circumstances. They and their
descendants became a distinctive part
of St. Augustine, and continued to
live in the city down to the present day.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3 id="c34"><i>During the Revolution</i></h3>
<p>Soon after Tonyn became governor
of East Florida reports began to reach
St. Augustine of unrest in the English
colonies to the north, followed by news
of bloodshed at Lexington and Bunker
Hill. Tonyn suspected some in East
Florida of being in sympathy with the
rebel cause, including his old enemies,
Drayton and Turnbull. Most of the
inhabitants, however, had arrived too
recently from England or other loyal
colonies to desire independence. St.
Augustine remained as faithful to its
English rulers as it had been to its
Spanish Kings.</p>
<p>In 1775 two detachments of troops,
comprising 160 men, were sent from
St. Augustine to Williamsburg, Virginia,
to support hard-pressed Governor
Dunmore. During August of that
year another incident brought the war
home. The British brigantine <i>Betsy</i>
lay off St. Augustine&rsquo;s inlet with a
cargo of gunpowder for the garrison.
A rebel sloop from Charleston swooped
down and captured it within sight of
people on shore. When the news of
the signing of the Declaration of Independence
reached this East Florida
capital, there was no rejoicing. Instead
angry Loyalists gathered in the
Plaza to cheer the burning of straw-stuffed
dummies, representing Samuel
Adams and John Hancock.</p>
<p>Expeditions left St. Augustine to
attack the &ldquo;traitorous neighbors&rdquo; in
Georgia and Carolina. They in turn
organized forces to invade East Florida.
These resulted in little more than
border skirmishes. The <i>East Florida
Rangers</i>, a militia organized by Tonyn,
plundered the frontier of cattle, from
the sale of which the governor is said
to have profited. As the war progressed
an increasing number of Loyalists fled
from patriot wrath into East Florida.</p>
<p>Some of the prisoners of war taken
by the British in various engagements
were shipped to St. Augustine to be
held until exchanged. In 1780 forty
prominent American Patriots, captured
at Charleston, were brought here.
They included three signers of the
Declaration of Independence&mdash;Edward
Rutledge, Arthur Middleton, and
Thomas Heyward, Jr.</p>
<p>The surrender of Cornwallis at
Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, marked
virtually the end of the conflict. The
English evacuation of Savannah in
1782, followed by their withdrawal
from Charleston, caused Loyalists to
pour into East Florida and St. Augustine
by the thousands. Housing was
inadequate. Many of the unfortunate
refugees lived in mere huts of thatched
palmetto leaves. Plays were given in
the statehouse for their benefit. One
of the newcomers set up a print shop
and began publishing Florida&rsquo;s first
newspaper, the <i>East Florida Gazette</i>.
The population of East Florida soared
to 17,000 including slaves.</p>
<p>In 1781 Governor Tonyn finally
called East Florida&rsquo;s first Legislative
Assembly. It met in the statehouse at
St. Augustine that year and again during
the winter of 1782-83. But there
was little left for it to do but pass
laws governing the conduct of the many
slaves, who had poured into East Florida
with their Loyalist owners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h3 id="c35"><i>Another Treaty</i></h3>
<p>Toward the end of the Revolutionary
War in 1779 Spain declared war
on England in alliance with France.
A Spanish expedition captured English-held
Mobile in 1780 and Pensacola
in 1781. Spanish spies were active in
St. Augustine, which braced itself for
an attack on East Florida that was
planned but never carried out.</p>
<p>Across the sea in Paris ministers of
England, France, and Spain gathered
again at the peace table, and another
treaty was concluded. On April 21,
1783, Governor Tonyn announced
what had already become generally
known, that England had ceded the
Floridas and Minorca back to Spain in
exchange for the retention of Gibraltar
and other territories. British subjects
were given eighteen months in which
to dispose of their property and evacuate
Florida.</p>
<p>This trend of events was a crushing
blow to East Florida&rsquo;s numerous English
residents. Many had just recently
moved to the province, purchased
or built new homes, and cleared land
for cultivation. New towns had grown
up, such as St. Johns Bluff, which contained
300 houses, two taverns, stores,
and even a lodge of Freemasons. Appeals
were addressed to the British
Crown to retain possession of East
Florida, but to no avail.</p>
<p>A period of confusion and disorder
followed. Lawless elements, termed
<i>banditti</i>, took advantage of the unsettled
conditions to plunder plantations
and travelers. The painful evacuation
of the English continued
through the year 1784 and the spring
of 1785. Many took the wilderness
trails to the west, others went to the
Bahamas, some returned to England,
or embarked for Nova Scotia, Jamaica,
Dominica and elsewhere. They took
with them all of their movable possessions.
Even the bells and pews of
their church, and a crude fire engine
were loaded aboard ship for transfer
to another colony in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>The Minorcans, who had moved to
St. Augustine from New Smyrna in
1777, were not greatly disturbed by
the impending change in sovereignty.
They were Catholics and spoke a language
similar to Spanish. They supported
themselves by fishing, hunting,
and by cultivating small groves and
gardens. Some had become small shopkeepers.
St. Augustine was their
chosen home.</p>
<p>Many English still remained when
Governor Z&eacute;spedes arrived off St. Augustine
with thirteen vessels to take
over the province of East Florida for
Spain. The official transfer of the
government took place on July 12,
1784. The Spanish flag was unfurled
again over the capital to volleys from
the Spanish infantry and a fourteen-gun
salute from the artillery. &ldquo;On
the following day,&rdquo; Governor Z&eacute;spedes
wrote, &ldquo;we rendered dutiful and solemn
adoration to Christ the King, by attending
the <i>Te Deum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curtain fell on twenty years of
English occupation, and a second period
under Spain began.</p>

tedious passage from New York, his Majesty&rsquo;s
ships Narcissus and Bellisarius, having under
convoy four vessels laden with provisions for this
province. Three other victuallers had sailed in
company, also for this place, but separated by some
accident on the passage.</p>

South Carolina and Georgia:

Hon. <span class="sc">Robert Digby</span> Esquire,

his tender and compassionate regard

the West-Indies, or any other
part of his Majesty&rsquo;s dominions,

<h2 id="c36"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Spanish Rule Returns</h2>
<p>When they reoccupied Florida
in 1784, the Spaniards had
changed but little during their
twenty-year absence from the scene.
With their return St. Augustine reverted
to its former status as an isolated
military post, heavily dependent upon
outside sources for its supplies and financial
support.</p>
<p>Agriculture was neglected and brush
soon covered the plantation fields,
which the English and their slaves had
cleared. Indians again roamed at will
through the countryside. On the heels
of the departing English they burned
Bella Vista, the beautiful country estate
of Lieutenant-Governor Moultrie,
located a few miles south of St. Augustine
in the community now bearing
his name.</p>
<p>The population of the capital, which
had overflowed into new districts just
before the English left, shrank to a
fraction of its former size. Only a
few score English remained to take the
required oath of allegiance to the Spanish
Crown. A relatively small number
of St. Augustine&rsquo;s former Spanish residents,
or <i>Floridanos</i>, uprooted in
1763, returned from Cuba to claim
their former homes. The Minorcan
group, including a few Greeks and Italians,
made up the major portion of St.
Augustine&rsquo;s civilian inhabitants.</p>
<p>Vacant houses stared blankly along
the narrow streets. Some with flat
roofs and outside kitchens were relics
of the first Spanish period. Others had
been remodelled after the English taste
with glass window panes, gabled roofs,
and chimneys. St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, in
which the English had worshipped,
remained unoccupied and soon became
a ruin.</p>
<p>Although a Spanish possession, St.
Augustine acquired from time to time
interesting residents of other nationalities.
Juan McQueen, a close friend
of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
and Lafayette, came to the city
in 1791 to escape embarrassing debts,
and held official positions under the
Spanish regime until death closed his
colorful career in 1807. John Leslie,
the famous English trader, also lived
here after the Revolutionary War. The
firm of Panton, Leslie and Company
enjoyed a monopoly in trading with the
Indians of Florida, and supplied St.
Augustine with many of its needs on
liberal credit.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Ruins of the Fish mansion on Anastasia, or Fish&rsquo;s Island, from a pencil sketch
made by the Rev. Henry J. Morton in 1867.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Philip Fatio, a Swiss, owned a large
plantation on the St. Johns River in
a section now known as Switzerland.
He maintained a store and residence at
St. Augustine, and had other extensive
land holdings. Among the Minorcan
group was an Estevan Benet, one of
whose descendants was Stephen Vincent
Benet, the noted writer.</p>
<p>Jesse Fish lived across the bay on
what is now called Fish&rsquo;s Island with
his many slaves and famous orange
grove, from which he shipped fruit and
juice to England. He was sent to St.
Augustine as a youth by a trading firm
during the first Spanish period, won the
confidence of the Spaniards, and remained
as custodian of some of their
property through the English regime.
The old patriarch still occupied his
coquina mansion across the bay when
the Spaniards returned.</p>
<p>Father Pedro Camps, Padre of the
Minorcan group, followed them to St.
Augustine from New Smyrna in 1777,
and continued as their beloved spiritual
leader until his death in 1790. Also
prominent in the city&rsquo;s religious life
was Father Michael O&rsquo;Reilly, an Irish
priest, who came with Governor Z&eacute;spedes
in 1784 and remained active until
removed by death in 1812.</p>
<p>Life in St. Augustine followed a
distinctive pattern, due to its isolation
and lack of frequent communication
with other cities. It was Spanish in
language, dress, customs, and for the
most part in architecture and population.
Some of its officials and planters
owned slaves, fine horses, and lived
comfortably if not elaborately. They
enjoyed leisure time for gambling, cock
fighting, and to lounge through the
long summers in a cool patio or at a
congenial tavern. The populace was
characteristically lazy and did little
more than necessary to keep body and
soul together. As in other Spanish
colonies, the <i>siesta</i>, or after-dinner nap,
was routine. During the mid-day heat
streets were deserted and nothing
stirred as if under the spell of an
enchanter&rsquo;s wand.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Old print of Plaza showing Cathedral and Constitution monument.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One of the chief additions made to
the city during its second Spanish
period was the construction of a
graceful new Parish Church. The
building was begun in 1791, dedicated
in 1797, and later consecrated as a
Cathedral. Damaged by fire in 1887,
it was restored the following year with
the addition of the present clock tower.
The Spaniards also commenced a new
Treasury building, which was never
completed due to lack of funds. Its
mute walls remained standing until
after the Civil War.</p>
<p>For a time the Spanish government
offered grants of land in East Florida
on liberal terms to attract settlers.
Hardy pioneers from the adjacent
South poured in, who secretly wanted
to overthrow Spanish rule. Fearing
this influence, Spain closed the territory
to further settlement by Americans
in 1804.</p>
<p>The story of East Florida and its
capital from 1800 on is one of increasing
difficulties, caused by the
course of events in Europe and friction
with neighboring southern states.
Spain&rsquo;s wealth and power were rapidly
declining. One after another her
American colonies sought and won their
independence. In the southeastern
United States sentiment for the possession
of Florida was fanned by Indian
raids and the loss of slaves across
the border, which Spanish officials
seemed to do little to control.</p>
<p>In 1812, to assuage popular clamor,
the Spanish Cort&eacute;s adopted a more
liberal constitution, and decreed that
monuments be erected to commemorate
it. At St. Augustine a coquina shaft
was raised that still graces its Plaza,
but scarcely had it been dedicated when
the constitution was revoked, and the
monuments were ordered dismantled.
Here only the tablets were removed
and later replaced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h3 id="c37"><i>The North Florida Republic</i></h3>
<p>When the war of 1812 broke out
between England and the United
States, it was feared that England,
then allied with Spain, might seize the
Floridas as a base for military operations.
The Congress authorized President
Madison to appoint two agents,
who were to endeavor to secure the
temporary cession of East and West
Florida to the United States. In the
event this failed, steps were to be taken
to forcibly occupy the provinces, should
England threaten to seize them.</p>
<p>President Madison appointed old
General Matthews as his agent to East
Florida. He was a Revolutionary War
veteran and a former governor of
Georgia. With promises of liberal
grants of land, Matthews encouraged
the planters along the northern borders
of East Florida to set up an independent
republic. The plan was to then turn
over the territory it occupied to the
United States. After seizing Fernandina
these Patriots, as they were
termed, advanced on St. Augustine
with a small detachment of regular
troops, occupied Fort Mosa on its
northern outskirts, and called upon the
Spanish governor to surrender. He
sent a gunboat up the river to dislodge
them, but they continued to camp in
the vicinity for several months. St.
Augustine was cut off from supplies
and the surrounding country plundered
by Indians and outlaws.</p>

agents and repudiate their actions.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c38"><i>A Bit of Spain</i></h3>
<p>In a <i>Narrative of a Voyage to the
Spanish Main</i>, published in 1819, an
Englishman gives the following description
of St. Augustine&rsquo;s residents
during this period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The women are deservedly celebrated
for their charm, their lovely
black eyes have a vast deal of expression,
their complexions a clear brunette;
much attention is paid to the arrangement
of their hair; at Mass they are
always well dressed in black silk
<i>basquinas</i> with the little <i>mantilla</i> over
their heads; the men in their military
costumes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same traveler later returned to
St. Augustine by land, and found the
city in a gay mood despite its difficulties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I had arrived at the season of general
relaxation, on the eve of the Carnival,
which is celebrated with much
gaiety in all Catholic countries. Masks,
dominoes, harlequins, punchinelloes,
and a variety of grotesque disguises, on
horseback, in carts, gigs, and on foot
paraded the streets with guitars, violins,
and other instruments; and in the evening
the houses were opened to receive
masks, and balls were given in every
direction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h3 id="c39"><i>Ceded to the United States</i></h3>
<p>After the War of 1812 there was
still friction between Spanish Florida
and the United States. Bands of Indians
and escaped slaves occupied choice
lands of the Florida interior, fortified
the navigable rivers, and made occasional
raids across the border. The
Spanish garrison was not large enough
to control lawless elements. In 1817
Fernandina and Amelia Island were
taken over by MacGregor, an English
soldier of fortune, later occupied by
the pirate Autry, and became a den of
outlaws and smugglers. United States
troops were sent to dislodge them and
restore law and order. General Andrew
Jackson led an expedition into
north central and west Florida in 1818
to punish the Indians, and after destroying
their strongholds occupied
Pensacola.</p>
<p>England and Spain vehemently protested
these violations of Spanish territory.
Negotiations for the purchase
of Florida were reopened. During
February of 1819 a treaty was concluded
whereby Spain finally ceded
Florida to the United States, which
appropriated up to five million dollars
to pay the claims of Americans arising
from the recent depredations. Spain
ratified the treaty in 1820.</p>
<p>On July 10, 1821, Colonel Robert
Butler and a small detachment of
United States troops received possession
of East Florida and Castillo de
San Marcos from Jos&eacute; Coppinger,
the last of the Spanish governors. After
the Spanish flag was lowered, leaving
the stars and stripes flying over the
fortress, Spanish troops marched out
between lines of American soldiers and
they mutually saluted. The Spaniards
then boarded American transports
waiting to convey them to Cuba, one of
the few remaining possessions of Spain&rsquo;s
great colonial empire in America.</p>

<h2 id="c40"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />Under the United States</h2>
<p>St. Augustine was at last a part
of the United States. Most of its
Spanish residents bid the narrow
streets farewell. The Minorcans, now
firmly domiciled here, made up the
major portion of the town&rsquo;s population.
Many by this time had risen to positions
of influence in its affairs.</p>
<p>Officials of the new regime found
St. Augustine a rather dilapidated old
town, devoid of progress and ambition.
Due to the poverty that had marked
the closing years of the second Spanish
period, public and private buildings
were badly run down, some almost in
ruins. Soon after the change of flags,
speculators and promoters flocked to
the city, and were quartered in some
of the deserted houses. In the fall of
1821 an epidemic of dreaded yellow
fever carried off many of the newcomers.
A new cemetery was opened
up near the City Gates to receive the
victims, a few of whom may have been
of Huguenot descent. It became known
as the Huguenot, or Protestant cemetery.</p>
<p>In spite of its unkempt condition,
St. Augustine possessed a certain mellow
charm. At times the scent of
orange blossoms hung heavy in the air
and could be noticed by passing ships
at sea. Along the narrow streets latticed
gates led into cool courtyards and
secluded gardens. There was no industry
or commerce to disturb the
serenity of the scene. St. Augustine&rsquo;s
shallow inlet, which preserved it from
its enemies, also prevented it from
becoming a place of bustling trade.</p>
<h3 id="c41"><i>Visitors Begin to Arrive</i></h3>
<p>Although difficult to reach by sea
because of its treacherous bar, and by
land over a road that was little more
than a trail, a few adventurous travelers
began to visit this quaint old city,
which the United States had recently
acquired. They were chiefly invalids
and tubercular victims, for whom the
mild winter climate was considered
beneficial. Ralph Waldo Emerson,
who was later to become the noted New
England poet and philosopher, visited
St. Augustine in 1827, at the age of 23,
suffering from what he termed a
&ldquo;stricture of the chest.&rdquo; During his
ten weeks&rsquo; stay he recorded in his journal
and letters his impressions of the
city as he then saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Augustine is the oldest town of
Europeans in North America,&rdquo; he observed,
&ldquo;full of ruins, chimneyless
houses, lazy people, horse-keeping intolerably
dear, and bad milk from
swamp grass, as all their hay comes
from the North.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/p31.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="599" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Napoleon Achille Murat, one of St.
Augustine&rsquo;s early visitors.</i></p>
</div>
<p>But it restored his health and later
he was inspired to comment: &ldquo;The air
and sky of this ancient, fortified, dilapidated
sandbank of a town are delicious.
It is a queer place. There are
eleven or twelve hundred people and
these are invalids, public officials, and
Spaniards, or rather Minorcans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While here Emerson met another
distinguished visitor of the time, Prince
Napoleon Achille Murat, son of the
King of Naples, and nephew of the
great Napoleon. Murat came to Florida
in 1824, purchased an estate south
of St. Augustine, and was a frequent
visitor to the city, living here for a
time during the Seminole War. He
later settled on a plantation near Tallahassee.
St. Augustine began to prosper
in a small way from its increasing
number of visitors and winter residents.</p>
<h3 id="c42"><i>The Freeze of 1835</i></h3>
<p>The growing of oranges was an important
industry in St. Augustine and
its vicinity at this time. Many of its
residents derived their principal income
from the sale of the golden fruit, which
was shipped by sloop to northern cities.
The town was described by visitors as
being virtually bowered in groves, and
on each side of the Plaza were two
rows of handsome orange trees, planted
by Governor Grant during the English
occupation.</p>
<p>During February of 1835 a biting
cold of extended duration swept down
out of the northwest. At nearby Jacksonville
the thermometer dropped to
eight degrees, and ice formed on the
St. Johns River. St. Augustine&rsquo;s
beautiful orange groves were killed to
the ground, sweeping away the main
source of livelihood for many of its
people. Only the bare trunks and
branches remained, making the city look
bleak and desolate.</p>
<p>Some of the trees sprouted from their
damaged roots; others were planted,
and in a few decades St. Augustine&rsquo;s
orange groves were again the subject
of admiring comment on the part of
visitors. But during the winter of
1894-95 another freeze destroyed them.
The citrus industry moved farther
south and was not again revived on a
commercial scale in St. Augustine or
its immediate vicinity.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h3 id="c43"><i>The Seminole War</i></h3>
<p>The Seminole War followed closely
on the heels of the disastrous freeze of
1835. Shortly after New Year&rsquo;s day
of 1836 St. Augustine learned of the
massacre of Major Dade and his command
of 110 men. They were ambushed
by Seminoles while enroute
from Fort Brooke (Tampa) to Fort
King (Ocala). On the same day, December
28, 1835, General Wiley
Thompson, the Indian agent at Fort
King, and another officer were killed.
Soon plantations in the vicinity of St.
Augustine were attacked and burned,
and refugees arrived with gory tales
of Indian atrocities. The February
27, 1836, issue of <i>Niles Register</i> carried
the following item:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole country south of St.
Augustine has been laid waste during
the past week, and not a building of
any value left standing. There is not
a single house remaining between this
city and Cape Florida, a distance of
250 miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this occurred the original Indian
tribes of Florida encountered by
the early Spaniards had completely
disappeared. Some had been wiped out
during the long period of border conflict
with the English. Others had
succumbed to epidemics of disease. By
the early 1800&rsquo;s the principal Indians
found in Florida were called Seminoles,
and were a combination of several
tribal remnants from Georgia and Alabama.</p>
<p>Under United States rule the Seminoles
were first restricted to a more
limited area by the Treaty of Moultrie
in 1823. But as settlers continued
to pour in, a demand arose for their
complete removal from Florida to reservations
in the West, which the younger
Seminole leaders were determined to
resist. The effort to force their removal
to western reservations resulted
in conflict that dragged on for seven
years, from 1835 to 1842.</p>
<p>Officer after officer was sent to
Florida to take command of operations
against the Indians, including General
Winfield Scott of subsequent Mexican
War fame; and General Zachary Taylor,
later to become President of the
United States. But roving bands of
Seminoles continued to strike and vanish
into the dense swamps and little
known woodlands.</p>
<p>In 1837 two prominent Seminole
leaders, Osceola and Coacoochee, with
seventy of their warriors, were seized
by General Hernandez under orders
from General Jesup at a point a few
miles south of St. Augustine. The
Indians had come in under a white
flag for a parley with United States
officers. The captives were brought
to St. Augustine and imprisoned in the
Castillo, from which Coacoochee and
twenty companions managed to escape.
Osceola died soon after transfer to
Fort Moultrie, Charleston.</p>
<p>During May of 1840 a party of
actors enroute from Picolata to St.
Augustine were attacked by Indians,
and near the same point two St. Augustine
residents were murdered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless to complain,&rdquo; stated a
news item of the day. &ldquo;The fact remains
that we have been pent up in this
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
little city for the last four years and a
half by a few worthless outlaws. Our
friends and neighbors, one after another,
have been hastened to the mansions
of the dead, and he who is foolhardy
enough to venture beyond the
gates may be the next victim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But St. Augustine as usual managed
to be gay. A young lieutenant, William
Tecumseh Sherman of later Civil
War fame, was stationed at Picolata
and frequently rode into St. Augustine
for diversion. In one of his letters
home he wrote under date of February
15, 1842:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inhabitants (of St. Augustine)
still preserve the old ceremonies and
festivities of old Spain. Balls, masquerades,
etc., are celebrated during the
gay season of the Carnival (just over),
and the most religious observance of
Lent in public, whilst in private they
can not refrain from dancing and
merry making. Indeed, I never saw
anything like it&mdash;dancing, dancing, and
nothing but dancing, but not such as
you see in the North. Such ease and
grace as I never before beheld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Motte, a young military surgeon,
made a similar observation in his
journal: &ldquo;The St. Augustine ladies certainly
danced more gracefully, and kept
better time, than any of my fair country
women I ever saw in northern
cities. It was really delightful to see
the beautiful Minorcan girls moving
through their intricate waltz to the
music of violin and tambourine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally most of the Seminoles were
killed or surrendered for transfer to
reservations in the West. A few were
allowed to remain deep in the Everglades.
There were probably less than
5,000 Indians in Florida at the outset,
yet the war involved the enlistment of
20,000 men, an estimated cost of thirty
million dollars, and 1,500 United States
casualties.</p>
<p>St. Augustine somewhat reluctantly
saw the war come to an end. The
presence of officers and troops had enlivened
its social life, and poured government
funds into the city.</p>
<h3 id="c44"><i>A Peaceful Interlude</i></h3>
<p>The end of the Seminole War made
Florida safe again for travelers. William
Cullen Bryant, the popular poet
and author, paid St. Augustine a visit
in 1843 and wrote articles about the
city that were widely read. He noted
that gabled roofs were rapidly replacing
the flat roofs of the first Spanish period,
and that some &ldquo;modern&rdquo; wooden buildings
had been constructed. More than
half the inhabitants still spoke the Minorcan,
or Mahonese language.</p>
<p>Another visitor of 1843 was Henry
B. Whipple, later a prominent Episcopal
Bishop. He found masquerading
still a popular pastime in the city.
Masking began during the Christmas
holidays and continued until Lent.
Small groups of people dressed in
various disguises spent the evenings going
from house to house, acting out
their parts and furnishing their own
music with guitar and violin. Whipple
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
wrote that St. Augustine was still full
of old ruins, and that &ldquo;he liked to
wander through the narrow streets and
gaze upon these monitors of time, which
whispered that the hands that built
them were long since mouldering in
the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1845 Florida became the twenty-seventh
state admitted to the Union.
Tallahassee had been selected as its
territorial capital in 1824, being a compromise
between St. Augustine and
Pensacola, both of which were difficult
to reach from most of the state.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>General Edmund Kirby Smith.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c45"><i>During the Civil War</i></h3>
<p>St. Augustine lived on, enlivened
during the winter by an influx of
visitors, and drowsing undisturbed
through the long summers until aroused
by another conflict&mdash;the Civil War.</p>
<p>Slaves played a relatively minor role
in its economy, as compared with the
rest of the state. Although a few plantations
in the immediate vicinity employed
slave labor, they were chiefly
used as domestic servants and were generally
well treated. There was considerable
Union sentiment in the city
due to its number of northern-born
residents.</p>
<p>Edmund Kirby-Smith, who had
played in St. Augustine&rsquo;s streets as a
boy, became one of the leading Confederate
Generals. His father came
to the city in 1822 as Judge of the
Superior Court and died here in 1846.
His mother continued to occupy their
home on what is now Aviles Street.
During January of 1861 she wrote her
son: &ldquo;Our hearts are steeped in sadness
and anxiety. Forebodings of evil yet
to come depress us. We are threatened
with the greatest calamity that can
befall a nation. Civil war stares us
in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same letter she tells of how
the news of Florida&rsquo;s secession from
the Union was received at St. Augustine:
&ldquo;Our state has seceded, and it
was announced here by the firing of
cannon and musketry, and much shooting.
A large flag made by the ladies
is waving on the square. By order
of the Governor of this State, the Fort,
Barracks, and Federal property were
taken possession of. Cannon are
mounted on the ramparts of the Fort
to defend it if any attempt should be
made to retake it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the shouting ceased and war
became a stark reality with its heartaches,
poverty, and privation. Many
young men from St. Augustine went
into the Confederate armies. The majority
of its northern-born residents
returned to the North to live for the
duration of the war. The flow of
visitors to the city ceased.</p>
<p>During March of 1862 a Union
blockading squadron appeared off the
inlet, and an officer came ashore with
a white flag to demand the city&rsquo;s surrender.
During the night its small
Confederate garrison withdrew. Next
morning St. Augustine was occupied
by Union forces and held by them
during the remainder of the conflict.
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
Before the Federal troops landed the
women of the city cut down the flag
pole in the Plaza so that the Union
standard could not be raised where
their Confederate banner had waved.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig42">

<p class="pcap"><i>Travelers complained bitterly of the service on the Picolata stage line, here

</div>
<h3 id="c46"><i>Tourist Industry Resumed</i></h3>
<p>When the Civil War came to an
end in 1865, St. Augustine was three
centuries old. As the effects of the
war and the reconstruction period wore
away, the entertainment of winter residents
and visitors was resumed. The
city was still exceptionally quaint and
foreign in appearance.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p34b.jpg" alt="{Mule-drawn streetcar}" width="500" height="551" />
</div>
<p>A visitor of 1869 found the Florida
House, one of the city&rsquo;s three small
hotels, crowded with guests and wrote:
&ldquo;The number of strangers here greatly
exceeded our expectations, and thronged
in every street and public place. The
fashionable belle of Newport and Saratoga,
the pale, thoughtful clergyman of
New England, were at all points encountered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city badly needed better hotels
and travel facilities. Visitors then had
to come up the St. Johns River by
steamer to Picolata, and from there a
horse-drawn stage jolted them for eighteen
miles over a miserable road to the
San Sebastian River, where a flatboat
ferried the carriage across the river to
the city&rsquo;s outskirts.</p>
<p>By 1871 travelers could go up the
St. Johns River by steamer to Tocoi
Landing, and there take a mule-drawn
car over a crude railroad that ran
fifteen miles east through the wilderness
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
to St. Augustine. It was called
the St. Johns Railway and a few years
later installed two wood-burning locomotives.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/p35.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="505" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The San Marco, St. Augustine&rsquo;s first great resort hotel, was opened in 1886,
and burned to the ground in 1897.</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c47"><i>Its Isolation Broken</i></h3>
<p>The bonds of isolation and inaccessibility,
which had retarded St. Augustine&rsquo;s
growth yet preserved its Old
World character, were gradually being
removed. Some signs of this awakening
were apparent. &ldquo;Hammers are ringing
on the walls of a new hotel,&rdquo; a visitor
noted, &ldquo;in which northern tourists are
to be lodged, a splendid coquina wall,
which might have stood for another
century, having been torn down to
make room for this ephemeral box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same observer lamented that
because of these changes the city was
losing some of it former charm: &ldquo;The
romance of the place is gradually departing
now. The merry processions of
the Carnival, with mask, violin and
guitar, are no longer kept up with the
old taste; the rotund Padri, the delicate
form of the Spanish lady, clad in
<i>mantilla</i> and <i>basquina</i> are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1883 the Jacksonville, St. Augustine
and Halifax River Railway
was completed, linking the city with
South Jacksonville. A mammoth four-story
wooden hotel, the San Marco,
arose on a site just west of the Castillo.
The tide of tourists swelled. Souvenir
shops, museums, and showplaces sprang
up.</p>
<h3 id="c48"><i>The Flagler Influence</i></h3>
<p>Among St. Augustine&rsquo;s many visitors
during the winter of 1883-84 was Henry
M. Flagler, one of the co-founders
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
of the Standard Oil Company. Immensely
wealthy, he came to rest but
was impressed with St. Augustine&rsquo;s
charm and possibilities. Many well-to-do
families were then wintering on the
southern shores of France and Italy, a
section known as the Riviera. Flagler
believed they could be induced to come
to Florida if proper facilities were
provided for them. He decided to invest
in the construction of luxurious
hotels at St. Augustine that would
make the Florida coast an &ldquo;American
Riviera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first hotel, the Ponce de Leon
was begun in 1885. Two others, the
Alcazar and Casa Monica (later renamed
Cordova), were soon underway
nearby. These and other Flagler-financed
structures were massively built
of solid concrete in a style of architecture
adapted from palaces in Spain.</p>
<p>The magnificent Ponce de Leon
opened on January 10, 1888, the Alcazar
and Cordova soon afterward.
Wealth and fashion flocked to St.
Augustine, which became termed the
&ldquo;Southern Newport.&rdquo; Sailboats dotted
the bay and fine carriages dashed about
the streets.</p>
<p>When Flagler began the construction
of his hotels, he also purchased the
small railroads in the vicinity, improving
their service and facilities as a
means of making the area easier to
reach. This marked the beginning of
the Florida East Coast Railway, which
he later extended down the coast,
creating Palm Beach in 1894, and
launching Miami upon its career of
magic growth in 1896.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h3 id="c49"><i>The Changing Scene</i></h3>
<p>Progress, like St. Augustine&rsquo;s former
invaders, had little respect for the past.
The old and storied inevitably gave way
to the new and so-called modern. Old
houses and remaining sections of the
defense lines were torn down to make
room for new buildings of the prevailing
period, and the changes were hailed
as a great improvement.</p>
<p>Even before this took place many of
the old landmarks had disappeared.
When building material was needed,
St. Augustine&rsquo;s residents of former
periods used the stone from some old
dilapidated structure. It was much
easier than cutting and transporting
new blocks of coquina from the Anastasia
Island quarries.</p>
<p>A visitor of 1870 reported: &ldquo;Although
the ruins of its former greatness
are to be seen on every side, yet
by one and another means the most
venerable are passing out of sight. The
Palace of the British Attorney General
(located opposite the Cathedral), which
it is said was of grand proportions,
has been torn down so that the material
could be used for other buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fires also took their toll. The settlement
was completely burned by
Drake in 1586, and again burned by
the Carolinians under Moore in 1702.
In 1887 flames swept the Cathedral
and portions of the block north of the
Plaza. Again in 1914 a disastrous fire
wiped out many of the buildings in
the older section of the city between
the City Gates and the Plaza.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h3 id="c50"><i>St. Augustine Today</i></h3>
<p>In spite of the many changes made
in its physical appearance down
through the centuries, many evidences
of St. Augustine&rsquo;s historic past have
managed to survive. Massive Castillo
de San Marcos still frowns upon the
bay as it did two centuries and a half
ago. The City Gateway, remains
as a mute reminder of the capital&rsquo;s
former defenses. The narrow streets
of the original town have defied complete
alteration, and still reflect their
Old World origin and character.</p>
<p>The ancient Plaza, with its refreshing
shade, is possibly more beautiful
now than when worn by the tread of
parading garrisons. Here also stood
the residence of a long line of Spanish
and English governors. Facing the
Plaza on the north the Cathedral
looks down in simple dignity, its
clock and sundial marking the infinite
procession of hours, days and years.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s long period under Spain
is reflected in some of its architecture,
in many of its street names, and in the
general plan of the older section, which
was laid out as specified by the Spanish
King. The name St. George Street,
honoring England&rsquo;s patron Saint, is a
legacy from the English period, as is
also Charlotte Street, named for the
queen of George III.</p>
<p>The bayfront commands a view of
waters where ships of many kinds and
from many ports once rode at anchor.
The original inlet through which they
sailed has disappeared, and a man-made
channel now cuts through the barrier
islands. Davis Shores, a popular residential
district across the bay, was once
a marsh from which the English shelled
the fort and town in 1740.</p>
<p>At the south end of the original
settlement the State Arsenal occupies
the site of the Franciscan Monastery,
from which the heroic Friars went
forth to Christianize the Florida Indians.
Across from it the Oldest
House, owned by the St. Augustine
Historical Society, preserves some of
the Spanish atmosphere of former periods.
Its connecting museum and library
contain many relics and records
of the past.</p>
<p>The Old Spanish Treasury on St.
George Street was once the residence
of the Royal Treasurer, from which
Treasury Street also derives its name.
North of the City Gateway the Fountain
of Youth perpetuates the memory
of Ponce de Leon&rsquo;s discovery of Florida
and man&rsquo;s longing for youth restored.
Occupying high ground nearby the
Mission of Nombre de Dios marks
the probable landing place of Men&eacute;ndez
and the hallowed spot where the
first Parish Mass was celebrated.</p>
<p>Few who visit St. Augustine can fail
to feel the romantic spell of its antiquity.
The memory of its eventful
past still haunts its sandy shore.</p>

Society. Assembled over a period of more than fifty years, and
spanning 400 years of history, these records include copies of

of microfilm.</p>
<p>Founded in 1883, the Society is dedicated to the preservation

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
